So in the last video, we just talked about kind

of the creative testing framework and systems, right?

We wanna be testing new creative, ideally every single week,

four new creatives, every single week.

We wanna be looking for a, you know, 25% plus

or minus success rate, where we can take

that winning creative, we can scale it vertically,

meaning increase the budget within the ad group,

but also take that creative

and move it to the scaling campaign.

Now, a really important step that most people make, uh,

mistake that people make in the steps here

is they're constantly trying to reinvent the wheel.

And what do I mean by that? I mean, every single creative

that they test, every batch they test is a,

a new swing, right?

So it's a totally new idea, totally new concept.

And that is an important part

of the creative testing process, right?

Is to be testing new angles.

That's how we find things like this video right here, which,

you know, is one of our best performers.

Now it's getting, you know, $8 leads.

It's, it's really, really doing exceptionally well, right?

And it's maintaining that.

But the problem is, what most people do is they test,

they find this winner, they run it

until they can't run it anymore,

and they move on to the next thing.

What we do is we look at this video

and we treat it as modular, not monolithic.

What does that mean? What is modular versus monolithic?

Okay? Let's go over here real quick.

So let's, monolithic is I have an ad,

and the, the whole 60 seconds of

that ad is kind of one self-contained thing, right?

It just, it's one thing. So if I wanna make more of 'em,

I just need to create something totally new, right?

It needs to be new, new, new.

What we like to do is we like to make creative

that's modular, okay?

So that means that, hey, every creative has a

intro, right?

It's gonna have a, a, a scroll stopping hook, okay?

And that hook is going to have, you know, it's gonna have

text overlays,

it's gonna have a, a visual.

So it's gonna be something I'm visually doing.

It's gonna have a, um, sound.

So it's gonna have something I'm, I'm saying,

and each one of these pieces can be swapped out

and changed, right?

This, but this is just intro.

Then there's gonna be the, the next scene in it, right?

Where it's gonna be, you know, this, this is scene one,

and then this is gonna go to another part of the video.

And this is scene two. And this might be a problem.

So we're gonna illustrate a problem,

and then it's gonna go to scene three, right?

And scene three is gonna be the, you know,

alternative solution or popular solution.

So what are people trying that they're failing?

And then scene four is going to go to the current solution.

So our solution, right? When and then why it's so great.

And then we're gonna have scene five, okay?

And scene five is gonna have, you know, social proof.

It's gonna have some, you know,

authoritative figure talking about the product,

it's gonna have customers talking about the product.

And then we're gonna have scene six.

And again, this is just one type of framework.

This is not the, the, we use this

for every single ad just to get the point across.

And then scene six is gonna have some type of really,

really, um, you know, unique special offer, right?

For TikTok for that channel.

It's gonna be a really special, crazy deal.

And then we might have another, you know, um, you know,

another scene where we stack, you know, some final,

you know, authority based proof, right?

So this might be more like customers,

and this might be a, a doctor figure, some type

of authority, right?

So each one of these is a piece,

and each one of these could be swapped out

for a, a different video, a different clip

that can go in there and replace that one.

And all of a sudden, now this video is a different video

because it has, you know, scene two

is now a different problem,

or the problem's presented in a different way,

or maybe a version has a different alternative solution,

or a version has, uh, you know,

different social proof in it,

or you test a, a different unique offer.

Maybe it's in this one was free shipping,

another one's a discount,

another one's a bonus stack, right?

That's three different ads. So

by treating the creative again as modular, meaning pieces

of a whole, not just this self-contained whole

where all these things are in one video

and you're redoing it from scratch every time,

this now allows me to take one ad

and turn that into a a hundred ads

or a thousand ads, all from a winning concept.

Now, each one

of these thousands is not gonna beat the control,

but even if, again, I'm batting at 25%, let's go back to,

we'll go back to a hundred here,

and I'm batting, you know, 25%.

Again, that means, hey, you know, 25

of these ads are winners.

Even when I'm doing a crappy job

and only doing 10%, that means from one winning ad,

I've been able to create 10 now winning ads.

So I've 10 x the number of winners that I found,

which 10 x the amount of scale I can do 10 x

and longevity, my created a 10 x is everything.

All right? And so that's exactly what we do.

When you look at this video, for example,

so this is a minute video, and this video,

I'm not gonna make you watch this whole thing,

but it's, it's really emotional

just for a dental I implant business.

It, it changed her life.

At the end of the video, she starts crying, right?

And so I told the guys, I was like, Hey, you know, let's

take this scene

where she starts crying, the emotional part part.

Let's clip that part. Let's put it as a,

a scroll stopping intro hook,

and then have it start the video.

So create this kinda loop where the end

of the video becomes the beginning of the video.

Now you have the end,

then it starts the video, and then it ends.

So you create this really cool loop

that's a really popular format on the platform.

And so we found this winner, and that's exactly what we did.

We then took the winner, the next week's creative testing

batch that we launched, we created a bunch of versions

of this video, and from there we found, hey, this one's,

you know, not doing, you know, $8,

but it's still doing $11, still beating a lot

of our, our controls there.

And so what we did is what I just said, we opened it

with the crying scene.

We took the, uh, the, the face of the business,

who's the dentist who does the, a lot of the implants.

And we put her as a green screen video

talking about a pointing to her.

So we combined format three, no work green screen format,

the authoritative face of the business people recognize,

and then also the more scroll stopping visual

of the woman crying.

The tears. 'cause people, if people are swiping

and they see a woman crying, people pay attention, right?

So why is she crying? What's going on, right?

The emotional side of it.

And, um, and yeah, so again, just to reiterate here,

every week when you're doing your creative testing batch,

you want to iterate on winners and test new winners.

So I'm not saying do either

or it's due, you know, or one or the other.

It's not binary, it's both.

So every week you should be taking big swings, right?

You should be looking for this next

winner that you can iterate on.

But when you do find winners, you should also be iterating

and creating different versions of it.

So, you know, it depends on kinda where you're at.

As a, as a business earlier on,

you're gonna be more heavily weighted.

You're gonna be, you know, 75, you know, 80%

is gonna be on looking for winners, like new winners.

'cause you don't have any winners yet. So you're gonna be

taking big swing, big swing, big swing.

But as you progress, this could look more like, you know,

50 50 where every week, you know, 50% of your test

and budget is going to, you know, new,

you know, net new angles.

And 50% is going towards, you know, iterating.

So meaning creating new versions of those winners.

And then from these iterations, you're finding more,

more winners that make you money.

My drawings really bad here,

and then 50% is going to finding, you know, net new angles

that can then move over here

and be iterate on for more winning angles.

Now one final part of this,

and then we'll move on to the next, next part of the module

is this should be creating kind of a flywheel where the,

the data you're getting from the iterations is feeding back

to your net new testing

because you're, you're, these aren't self-contained.

So it's, hey, if I find

That green screen or duets or reactions

or this, this type of person in a video is doing really,

really well, consistently, I wanna start my net new angles

in the best possible place.

And so I'm gonna take this data,

feed it back into the net new testing,

and that just increases the odds that I find more winners,

increases the efficiency and profitability,

and it brings me more stuff

that I can move into this iterative testing environment.
