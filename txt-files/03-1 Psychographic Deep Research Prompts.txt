Hello, hello. I don't know why I should have thumbs down on my screen,

that's pretty annoying. But, um, welcome to this module where we will be covering

psychographic research. So,

as a very quick recap, we went through product market awareness levels,

then we went through, then we went through competitor research, now we're doing psychographic

research. After that, we'll look at stacking it all together to create a sort

of, like, meta research document brief that we can use

to feed to larger language models when writing different types of copy.

Before we continue on, I want to zoom out and say something kind of

important. Which is that,

with these deep research tools, you have the ability

to get data really fast. And then,

as you're going to see a little bit in this module,

and also in the following module of combining it all together,

you have the ability to

summarize it, make it actionable, feed it to an LLM,

and you don't really even need to write it.

Read or understand everything you're getting.

I've already spoken to that in some of the past modules,

where I'll skim through, get to a table,

all of that. What I want to be really clear on is that in

a perfect and ideal world, it is worthwhile for you to read

the full deep research reports that you're getting,

okay? Like I was thinking about this because I have been a little bit

flippant with the length of these deep research reports and it being overwhelming

and all of that, because it can be overwhelming.

And so, what I don't want,

and what I've seen happen working with thousands of people over the years,

is there's people who are fact finders and who get

in the weeds and who overthink everything,

and they find a way to take something incredible like AI and LTE.

LLMs and still move really slow,

right? And it is really inexcusable at this point.

You cannot move slow anymore. That being said,

especially if you're new to a market or you don't really have a ton

of experience, it's worthwhile to

just read through everything at least the first time, okay?

Like, that doesn't mean, You need to take days

to do it, but at least like skim through because there will always be

little insights that might end up being really valuable that might get missed when

you summarize stuff with LLMs. Okay,

so I just want to make that point before we jump in. Now,

regarding psychographic research, what are we talking about here?

When it comes to traditional market research,

there's demographic research,

and you might see that word right here, and there's psychographic research.

To be honest, I put, like, insight into the demographic,

but that does not mean this part below that you're going to look at

in a minute is demographic research. demographic research is kind of traditional woman

age 45 plus with a median household income or average household

income of $80,000 who are married,

uh, you know, and who identify

more liberal leaning and are,

uh,

more likely to rent than to own,

or more likely to own a house than to rent, or whatever it is,

right? Like, it's sort of like that basic,

like, details or characteristics of who

your market is. Like, sort of the facts, right?

Psychographic research,

as you might kind of guess from the, the root of that,

psycho, When you think of, not like a psycho, like a bad person necessarily,

but psychology, psychiatry,

right? that's like, it's more about the mind,

and it's like, deeper. This is more about the psychology of your target market.

And so, when we do psychographic research,

we're trying to understand them on a bit of a deeper level.

And so, you'll see here, in some of these questions,

and we go through a list of questions, and we'll explain the prompt after,

but, like, right, what are their hopes for hopes and dreams,

and what are their victories and failures? For those of you who went through

RMBC1, or have seen me teach research before,

these questions may be familiar to you, right?

And, I'll show you real quick, this was the original art from RMBC,

it's got these questions here, this thing has served people extremely well over the

years, I was really the first person to teach psychographic research as it comes

to copy, I was also the first person to teach unique mechanisms,

but, not to give myself flowers,

but I mean, it's just, it was really kind of revolutionary at the time,

because people didn't do this,

and so it seems so simple, but, to me now, especially in 2025,

but this was really powerful, okay?

Now,

basically all those questions are going to be in this prompt here,

and I'll go through them. And if you've seen RNBC before,

Sorry, but it'll be a pretty quick summary,

and we'll get to the prompt, the outputs, what we're looking for,

and some other really cool stuff, okay? So I'll get back to the prompt

itself, but like, okay, who is your customer?

This is the one that's like, sort of, traditional,

demographic type of stuff, 45 plus women,

50 plus men 18 plus 18 to

35 year olds men looking for a side hustle,

additional income, amateur golfers,

typically 50 plus men in rural areas,

whatever it is, right? Uhm,

this is here. Attitudes,

like, what attitudes do they have? This is worth

understanding, in a lot of cases,

if you're speaking to, like, a Thank you.

You know,

are you speaking to a conservative demographic?

Are you speaking to a Christian demographic?

Are you speaking to a New Age demographic? Even their biases,

when we go to social or economic, okay, it's like,

do they tend to believe that Wealth is earned,

you know, through hard work, you can get ahead and make money,

and that the rich people are good, they tend to believe that the rich

are bad, and that people who have a lot of money probably committed a

crime or are guilty of a sin. Uhm,

you know, things like that, why would that matter when you go to write

copy? Well, if you're doing,

like, BizOp, and you're talking to people who believe that billionaires are evil,

then your messaging It's amazing. It's a lot different than if you're talking to

people who believe that with hard work, anyone can become a billionaire and to

see American dream in the case of an American market,

right? Things like that. Uhm,

so, the messaging might

look like, finally you can

level the playing field, like the greedy 1% billionaires,

like no- this secret that they've been keeping from the rest of us,

but now you can have it, right? Versus the same secret that Elon Musk

and Steve Jobs and the- dude who runs,

uh, the video, like, used to become billionaires or something that anyone can use

to start a side hustle profitably, like,

if you've got, like, if you've got a brain in your skull and common

sense and you're willing to- put in the work,

like, you know, this is a sure-fire way

to start generating some passive income or whatever it is,

right? Not gonna over worry on the compliant claims in the example here about

if you could say that something is a sure bet for passive income,

okay? Don't at me. But do you see how you would speak differently?

Political is pretty obvious. I mean, well, I don't know if it's obvious,

but it should be. Like, say you're due- I mean,

I mean, even for health, right? If somebody- if your market tends to lean

really conservative, then you could kind of talk about what Trump and RFK are

doing and how it's important and good. If your market lean is left,

you're, like, how RFK and Trump are trying to destroy

access to these, you know, health in America,

right? Like- you don't have to get that hardcore in your marketing,

but it's just good information to have. Hosts and dreams?

It's like- as it relates to the pain point,

the problem that your product is solving. What do they hope happens,

right? Like- it goes beyond just like,

uhm, don't have wrinkles.

It's like feeling confident, sexy in your own skin,

you know, feeling beautiful, right? It can be like,

uhh. Being

a leader, it can be- loving who you see looking back in

your- in the mirror. It could be- speaking

in front of a crowd, you know,

um, being like for a business, right? You're speaking in front of a packed

audience, sharing your success story- rags to riches story.

Obviously, it could be things about taking your family on vacation,

to Disney, and getting the fast-pass lane,

and- or the lightning lane,

or whatever they call it, and uh,

staying in with the on-site properties,

going out to dinner, buying your kids whatever they want,

and not even flinching at the crazy price tag.

You know? What are the victories and failures?

So, this would relate to how they've tried to solve their paint point in

the past, right? And so, victories, maybe it might be-

Well, I'm- let's go to Bizop.

Like, well, I've got a good, uh, you know, I've got a good job,

I've got a little bit of money saved away. Uh,

I don't feel like I'm- Hanging on by a thread,

I feel like, you know, I've got some financial stability,

right? What about a failure? I've tried two different side businesses in the

past, both times. They've been a huge waste of time and money.

If I had just put that money aside and saved it or invested it,

I would have been better off ahead. I don't know that I'm

making- It makes me worried about trying to create

a side income in the past, maybe it's not for me. You know,

skincare, umm.

I've done, uh, I started worrying, like,

sunscreen when I was young, I think that's really helped me.

My- I think I see some people who have wrinkles who are way worse

than mine, so I know it could be worse.

It could be a victory. Failure might be- I keep buying these expensive products.

I- I'm trying to do everything. It's not,

you know, but I still see wrinkles, or like,

failures like, I try to get even, you know,

Botox, but honestly, in my face look unnatural,

I'm worried that if I keep doing that,

I'm gonna look awful, uh,

you know, unnatural and- and everything,

and- and so, you know,

whatever. Like, we'll go through more concrete examples shortly here.

What outside forces do they believe have prevented their best life?

So, a lot of people,

when it comes to a pain point or a problem, have an external,

like, believe they're- likely believe they're maybe an external culprit,

right? So going back to, like, uh,

social or economic attitudes, they might believe that,

like, you know, they're written- which America's tax system and

the government and everything is just served- created to serve the rich in the

1% and it's designed to keep people who are poor,

poor, and people in middle class, in the middle class and not let you

get ahead, right? For a health ailment,

it might be something about, you know,

big pharma, um.

Purposely keeps cures from you. It could be that big pharma prevents,

uh, you know, gives

you medications that help treat the symptom has been ever the root cause.

The food system is so f***** up.

Like, environmental toxins, right? There's so many toxins in the environment,

pollution, microplastics, whatever it is that you're not,

like, uhh, it doesn't matter what you do, the deck is stacked against you,

right? Those are good things to know. Why are they good to know again?

Because we can speak to those things. Hey, you may feel this way,

right? Like, you may feel that the deck is stacked against you.

You know, I know I can feel that way. I feel like, when it

comes to my health, uh, you know, I look at all the toxins and

crap in my water and food, even if you're organic,

and I'm like, maybe it's all hopeless, right? But it's not, I'm gonna share

what you can do.

Okay, what are their prejudices? So,

prejudices is a weird word. We're not talking about, like,

I mean, unless you're selling something to, like, racist.

We're not talking about, like, racism, right? Um,

but we are talking about, like, biases, and,

so, prejudice can begin to be a prejudice against big pharma,

against big doctors, against big government.

It could be a prejudice against,

Big business. Umm,

you could be a prejudice against a different age group, right?

So, you'll see us in examples with the skincare.

Like, you'll see a lot of women who are 45-plus,

who are looking for solutions to wrinkles,

or crow speed, or fine lines. Uh,

have some prejudice against younger women advising the month skincare.

So, let's talk about how talking took a 25-year-old...

rep at a beauty counter.

The rep, like, doesn't get it, doesn't understand them,

is lucky. You'll see a lot of times, with biz-op,

target towards young people, they have prejudice,

prejudices towards baby boomers. So, yeah, baby boomers got lucky.

They bought a house for a dollar.

And, you know, 1985, and now the houses were $4

million. Umm, they're kind of selfish. They're self-s-selfish.

You know, a lot of criticisms towards baby boomers.

Now, if you're a baby boomer, I'm not saying that's true.

I'm telling you that that's a prejudice that younger people have against you.

Not all of them, but some, right? So, it'd be worth exploring that and

understanding, and figuring out if we need to talk about that in her copy.

And that's true of whether we're talking about a long-form sales letter,

an advertorial, an ad, whatever it might be,

okay? A product page, so on.

And then we're gonna- I sum up their core beliefs about life, love,

and family, right? Like, who are they? What are they believe?

What are their aspirations? You know, what positive?

What negative? How do we sum that up, okay? Then we're gonna look at

other existing solutions. Now, we really did competitive research,

specific to our product. That's helpful. But that's just our

product. There's a wide variety of products and solutions available to the

market for almost any time.

That's the of pain point you can imagine.

So, obvious one, weight loss,

right? Well, there's, like,

weight loss supplements. There's workout programs.

There's gym memberships. There's GLP1 medications.

There's online coaching.

There's diets. There's eating,

like, healthy and general organic, whatever.

The list can go on and on. And that's true for kind of anything.

So, okay, what are they, what are they already using to try to solve

their pain point? What has your experience been like,

right? Like, mixed bag,

good, bad, right? And what are they like about existing solutions?

And what are they not like about existing solutions? Are there any horror stories?

Why is that good? Well, I mean, we want to relate to it. If

people, a lot of people, use,

I mean, I read a horror story yesterday that was sharing on Reddit for

someone with, like, plastic surgery. It was a post from a guy.

I met his wife had plastic surgery. He told her he had not to

do it. She did it anyway. And now he doesn't want to make a

love to her. And so he was doing it less and less.

We'll turn the lights off. He's not attracted to her. His wife kept crying.

He would say he was tired. Eventually,

She kept pushing and finally was like, look, I'm getting, Yeah, I'm not attracted

to you anymore. Like, you know, I love you,

but I'm sorry,

I'm not attracted to you. You kind of scare me the way your face

looks. And the way he starts crying, he's crying,

he goes to her sister's house. Her sister and all her friends hate him,

say he's a monster. He doesn't know what to do. He loves her.

But, you know, she looks up like he's just not attracted anymore.

That's a crazy horror story about plastic surgery,

right? So, So, if you find stuff like that,

it could be worthwhile to have it. You could reference it and copy or

an ad, so he gives you an idea for an ad or a sales

letter or a VSL, right? Umm.

Does the market believe existing solutions work? Also really important.

So we talked about all of these, what they like, what they don't like.

Ultimately, do they, do they think? If everyone in the market thinks there's a

magic solution, it's good to know,

right? So for example, I would imagine GLP1 medications.

Which are like, oes epic, uh,

manjaro, legovii, zepobound,

things of that nature. People believe they work.

But, if I'm trying to go against them, by the way,

I sell these, like, through one of my Thomasan platforms,

we provide patients access to them,

through licensed U.S. medical providers. I don't excel them,

but we're like, a middleman, so to speak, right? Um,

but if I was going against GLP1 medications, I could definitely find a way

to ask stories than people who've had adverse events or reactions,

right? Will they not like about it? Well,

they don't like the cost, um,

they don't like the idea of injecting themselves,

they don't like the fact that it's a medication, right?

So even if they believe it works, it doesn't mean you can't, still contrast

against it if you have a better solution,

right? They don't believe it works, why not? Okay,

curiosity. This stuff gets a little bit weird, and we're almost done,

so stick with me for this part. Okay,

has someone tried to solve the market's pain points before in a very unique

way? What was the result? Is there a conspiratorial story behind why old solutions

didn't work? Are there any older attempts to solve this problem for the 1960s

that are unique? Um, what happened with a successful,

but for gone? Or were they a failure and why? This is just always

interesting stuff for copy fodder, right? If you look at,

I used examples of- down here, like, Nicola Tesla,

right? So these days, we've tested such a big brand that she probably has

put Nicola Tesla in, uh, the energy space,

right? There's a story about big energy didn't want his solutions.

He was discredited and ashamed. His inventions and discoveries were thrown into the ash

heap of history until now, right? Um,

I had a fungus thing back in the- I didn't have fungus,

but I did a prod for a nail fungus, and it's true.

It was like in World War II, uh, there's this huge issue of our

troops in the South Pacific. Now gonna just I'll see you time. in the

our troops being the U.S. troops. I know this is a- people all over

the world will watch RBC too. So, you know,

the U.S. troops in the South Pacific, um,

they were in these damp tropical environments. Nail fungus was this really big issue.

Uh, they discovered undistylenic acid and,

you know, give it to troops. It helps to win the war,

right? The nail fungus cure that helped win World War II.

It's still a great banger promo. Um,

I tried doing a- a really compliant nail fungus thing back in the day.

Within, it didn't- it didn't hit,

but to be honest with you, I still think this could hit. So, somebody

watching this will probably jack it and try it. I still think it's a

great potential winner from an angle.

Um, but those are examples,

right? Um, you know, there's like the classic ones I doctor- I said that

down here, is it? I mean,

this is sort of corruption. Oh, it's a corruption, but it goes- like,

you know, like a big far- like there's the whole thing. RFK talks about

this, right? What- love or hate him? It doesn't matter.

He talks about how basically all these like big tobacco food scientists got brought

over to the- or sorry, big tobacco scientists got brought over to the,

uh, food industry in the 80s with the merger of RJ Reynolds and

I think it was craft Nabisco. There's a huge merger in the 80s.

There's a great book and movie about it called Barbarians of the Gate about

the corporate merger. But anyway, umm.

Okay, like, you know. In

this case, I guess it wouldn't be that they didn't work, but it's sort

of like a conspiratorial thing around how they,

you know, food used to be good, they came in and f***** up.

I guess that's corruption, too. And they're kind of hand-in-hand.

Somebody just gets a corruption and we can kind of further- there.

But again, I guess to finish it here, like,

why I think it didn't work.

So, like, I guess, I guess if I'm really trying to be specific,

and I, as a teacher, I need to be here, right?

This is really like, you heard this thing didn't work,

umm.

Or, it didn't work but was suppressed,

right? Like, so,

Nikola Tesla, you heard he was a quack. Actually, his stuff didn't work.

He was, you know, conspiratorial,

it was conspiracy, you know, who killed the electric car is a classic,

you know, kind of conspiracy thing, right? Umm.

Oh, hey, this was a solution that worked for,

you know, during World War II for nail fungus. It really is more about

foot fungus, so to be honest with you. But, umm,

it got forgotten, right? There's always these old solutions that work.

People do if, umm,

I mean, I could do if, like, whip to Talo now, right? I thought

about that. With, uh, the Talo thing I talked about in an earlier module

that we're selling. Which, probably, I've had some really good days with the new

ads, where we've been at, like, a, I think yesterday,

we had, like, a $60 CPA, which is really good for us.

Umm.

And it's because of the product market awareness stuff I talked about.

It's pretty cool, actually. Umm.

We've been profitable for several days in a row, and it's because I shifted

the product market awareness in, right? Super important. Umm. Oh,

you know, like, farmer, like, you can do a whole story about,

right? Like, the, like, the dust

bowl farmer wives of, like, you know,

Oklahoma, and the 1930s,

who had perfect glowing skin, right? Because they knew this remedy about this,

like, Talo, as a beauty product.

Like, we forgot about it, now we're bringing it back. You know,

you can talk, like, ancient ad, or, you know, we do- We'll see research

to validate this, but, you know, ancient people using Talo,

um, and how they- their skin looks,

right? Cool. Okay.

And then corruption. Is there a belief that the market's pain point used to

not exist, or used to not be so bad? Is there a belief that

has been recently exasperated by outside forces?

If so, what are those forces, and what's the reason behind the present?

So, kind of going back to the diet itself, and,

you know, I mentioned, like, it's sort of like, okay, this is really where

you do the RJ- for you guys. And all this crafty Bisco,

evil tobacco scientists go into the food industry angle,

right? Food used to be good. We're solid.

In the 80s, a bunch of, like, big tobacco scientists got hired by big

food companies to make the products more addictive. They added additives,

preservatives, chemicals, fake sugars,

seed oils, all this stuff. Food got totally f***** up.

That's why you have always problems. Now, by the way,

that happens. It's not really your fault. It's these evil outside forces that have

corrupted everything, right? Another example would be,

like, Dr. Ansel Keys. I talked about this from the original R&B-C,

but this guy in the 50s,

I believe, um, came in and basically said,

you know, fat is the culprit. Like, dietary fat is why people are having

heart attacks after, I believe it was Eisenhower had a heart attack.

Our Truman, one of the other pictures of Eisenhower. and how our,

I might have been sure.

Whatever, it doesn't matter. Umm, fat is the bad guy.

So everyone moved to, like, low fat,

which meant high carbs, more processed foods, sugar,

you can link the two, right? All that happened.

Big tobacco scientists go into big food.

They make these kind of, like, franken foods even worse.

And we've just been f*****. By the way, look at the data.

See how obesity, diabetes, heart disease,

cancer. Right? All this stuff goes up ever since the 1950s.

So the idea is corruption, right? Paradise loss.

We had the Garden of Eden and we lost it. The classic thing in

more, like, direct response, clipping salve DSLs is sort of,

hey, there's this. Why do these people in this remote region without,

you know, modern healthcare not struggle with,

um, whatever it is,

like, foot fungus, diabetes, bad teeth,

whatever, right? Why did ancient people look at the- You know,

in the Clickbank world there was pro-dentum, it's like a dental BSL.

So here's a set of 2000 year old fossilized teeth,

even though they had no dental stuff at all. There's not single cavity or

crack, the teeth are still strong, even though they're outside and the sun and

then buried under the ground and attacked by bacteria for 2000 years.

How are these teeth still so good? Well, there's one thing they did that

we don't do today, right? Um,

so it's powerful- a simple messaging that can be used in ads,

VSLs, et cetera, angles, hooks,

ideas. There's a lot of things that can be generated by the research

that we do. Okay,

so let me go through the prompt and I'll stop this video and I'll

start a new video of examples that way you don't feel so firehosed.

And you can digest this. So what we're doing these days is

we're going to run a prompt where we tell deep research,

hey, you know, we're writing copy, targeted for a different demo,

market info. Here are questions I want answered.

Do deep research to answer them. That's a broad view. I'll go through it

actually more detail in the next video, which I'm basically going to record in

five minutes from now. Um, my time. So you'll,

you'll, you'll get all this from RBC too.

But, I just want to break this up into chunks for you. Um,

so we have a lot of things to go through. But we'll look at

the actual prompt, the prompt and action examples.

We'll look at how to get even more pain points when we feel like

deep research doesn't give us enough. Um,

we'll look at how to combine, if we use multiple alums for deep research,

how to combine them into one. So I go graphic document using cloud.

And, uh, it'll be cool. So,

I'll see you in the very next video here. Thanks.
