Alright, so this is going to be super fast.

It's just how to create the Clod project for unique mechanisms.

Um, if you've never created a Clod project before,

when you're in Clod, go to Projects.

You'll see different ones here. Click Create New Project.

Name your project, you'll do a description, and click Create Project.

So, like, you know, Mechanisms. What are you trying to achieve?

Description. Uh, Create Project.

Once you do that, you can upload your project knowledge base.

So, you can also add instructions.

I just basically took the same thing from the description and put it here.

You're going to have access to that, okay, and save those instructions.

And then you just upload documents to create a knowledge base.

I mean, I made this one a while ago. Um,

it's worth experimenting with if I do experiment with this.

Later on, improve it and make it even better. I will share that update

with RBC2 people if it's within the first, you know,

year or so when the course gets launched. Um,

but, this is the description right here.

I mean, it's super simple.

And then, these PDFs are basically just mechanism examples and some transcripts from causal

or unique mechanisms, things like the VSR.

Um, so I don't really feel like

I need to go through the PDFs.

You have this, you're ready to go, and then you can use your cloud

project in the way you saw in this whole training.

Um, and all the examples, you know,

the Airbnb and ice rink examples, etc. Um,

and as you can see, it's a fun player outfit experiment.

It's, uh, it'll be, you know, it's useful. It's not what I do all

the time, but you saw some use cases for it in those examples.

And there you go. So super easy and,

uh,

you know, easy peasy. All right. Thanks.
