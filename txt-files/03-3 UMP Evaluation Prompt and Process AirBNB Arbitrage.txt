Okay, so here's where it gets,

I think, actually really cool and really helpful,

which is evaluating which of the unique mechanisms to go with.

So, as a copywriter,

I'm going to not make this too theoretical or philosophical,

but there's a good book I read about it, but I'm going to for

a minute, You know, there's a really good book about, um,

you know, AI wrote early on,

um, but really honestly, I mean, like, 2021,

2022, I think it was called, like,

um, what's it called? Power and Prediction,

I think, something like that. Yeah.

It's by some University of Toronto AI scientists,

um, and there's another one.

When it came out, it says it here, but, um,

essentially one of the things that they talked about is this gap,

you could call it, that exists between,

I'll simplify it like this way. There's one thing to get great outputs,

there's another thing to have judgment, right? And so,

their argument was where AI will take longer to supplant humans

is when it comes to judgment.

By judgment,

I mean, like, okay, hey, here's four colors that I could paint the inside

of a house for a client without,

you know, here's the information of the client, which color should I choose?

Here's the thing, that's not even a great example, because AI is actually getting

pretty good at judgment, but they don't have the total overall

edge here. So,

when you do mechanisms like in the processes I've shared and you're a really

good copywriter, a really seasoned person,

you might, no,

you might, sorry, I'm going to say it differently, you will probably have opinions

on which mechanisms you like the most, right? So, if we kind of come

back to our examples,

like the one from Gemini, uhm,

let's see, the ICM one. So

we had this Gemini thing here, right?

And I really liked the asset gap versus the income gap.

If you watched that video, you saw how excited I got, I'm like,

this is sick, like, it was the one.

I got the most excited about, uhm, up until that point,

right? I really liked it.

Because I really like the

idea of you're trying to

solve an asset gap problem with an income gap solution.

It's like a good big idea. We'll talk about big ideas, but it's like,

it's really intuitively grasped. You can intuitively grasp it.

It sounds like a real thing. Like, it's good,

right? Uhm,

then, if you go back to the

second time we ran it, we're told it to focus on problem-aware.

Digital

serfdom. I liked,

and then the idea of the permission-based income trap,

I really liked, right? And I liked some of the others,

too. We saved those all and took a, a document.

But if you watched, I think you would say that I'm telling the truth.

You could tell that I got excited about those ones,

and some other ones, too. And I'm partly pre-framing this because of the outputs

that I got. But the reason I was excited wasn't

just purely a gut feeling.

It wasn't, it was an intuition, but it was also based on experience and

knowledge and all these things that are generally hard to replace.

And they're generally why I'm going to typically beat you

if we go head-to-head on copywriting or marketing or all that.

And what I'm sharing with you is a blueprint where if you follow it,

that may not be true. And by the way, I mean, it's not just

copy. If we go back to the product market awareness, it's at a really

high level of a lot of stuff, right?

Because now, you know, if you're paying attention,

who to speak to, what language to use,

what not to do, right? How to shoot, not shoot yourself in the foot

by going after a different level of product marketing.

market awareness than you should be, and so on.

Right? So, giving you all that

context. But the question becomes,

what if I,

well, sorry, I feel like I'm doing non-sequitur sentences.

It's kind of late, but I'm excited to do this module, so I wanted

to just do it now so the question becomes okay look what if I

What if I don't have that experience or that judgment? What can I do?

And while it may be uncomfortable, asking AI

to evaluate for you, at this point,

with good models, is not

Not a bad idea, and it's typically going

to actually make pretty good sense. Decisions. So let's look at this,

how we do that, okay? I'm working on some direct response sales copy that

will sell a product to niche. I'm going to share a few documents with

you. The first is a unified research document that has relevant information for a

market that my business will be selling to. It includes information,

The level of product market awareness we'll be speaking to,

competitor analysis, and key psychographic information.

The second document has several unique mechanism ideas that could be used in our

sales copy when selling our products or services to the market.

Here's a reminder of what a unique mechanism is and why it's important.

So same thing we had before, that unique mechanism stuff.

Here's what I want you to do. Evaluate each unique mechanism idea based on

their potential for connecting to our target market and persuading them to buy the

product we are selling and rank them from most likely to succeed to least

likely to succeed. In order to make this evaluation,

consider the unified research brief and the beliefs, attitudes,

awareness levels, and competitive environment within which our target customer finds themselves.

When making your rankings, keep in mind that our core market is people who

are problem aware. This is something you could change out.

Please go ahead and do this now. Okay, that's the whole prompt.

You could substitute in a product to niche,

or you can not. So, let's look at this in action.

First place I did it was Claw. I didn't even change,

uh,

you know, this out. It said product niche. I uploaded the unified research brief

for the Airbnb, uh,

rental arbitrage coaching program and those mechanisms that I had here.

I saved them as a PDF and uploaded them, right? So,

let's see Claw's ranking. Looking at your unique mechanism ideas through the lens

of your problem or target market, I'll evaluate and rank them based on their

potential to connect with prospects who are actively seeking ways to make more money,

but haven't yet identified rental arbitrage as their solution.

Ranking most to least likely to succeed.

Number one, the asset gap Bye. Why? It's number one.

This mechanism perfectly diagnoses the core frustration of your problem or audience.

They're stuck in the end. My cat is coming up here trying to make

a cameo. He's going to get kicked out in a second, but let me

finish this paragraph before I do. They're stuck in the endless cycle of seeking

more income through side hustles when their real problem is lacking wealth building assets.

This directly addresses their experience of trying dropshipping,

freelancing, and gig work only to remain financially stable. The language of being confined

to earning active income versus building wealth through appreciating cash flowing assets will resonate

deeply with prospects who feel that traditional paths aren't working.

All right, the cat was kicked out. Number two,

the permission-based income trap, mechanism 2.2.

Why is number two? This powerfully explains their feelings of powerlessness across

all their income sources from their nine to five to their failed side hustles.

The concept that they're always asking for permission to earn a living will create

immediate recognition. The solution to building a permissionless cash flow system directly delivers on

their core desire to take back control and be your own boss.

So,

I asked Claude, ChatTVT, and Gemini,

by the way, for their rankings on this. Uhm,

but it is kind of crazy when you think about it.

I mean, I wish I had just ranked them personally. Personally, before I did

this exercise, so for some of the other examples I'll do,

like skincare, golf, whatever it is, I probably will,

uhm,

do that to see how they match up or whatever.

But, whatever. Number three. Uh,

digital serfdom. Asset control arbitrage.

Mechanism 2.1. Uh,

why is number three? Digital serfdom concept brilliantly explains why all their online ventures

left them feeling like they were building someone else's dream. The metaphor of being

a tenant farmer on digital platforms will strongly resonate with their past failures.

However, it's slightly less universal than the permission-based income trap since it specifically targets

digital failures rather than all income sources.

That's something I brought up too, remember? Uhm,

and it goes on to, you know, do the rest of these.

The active to passive decay rate.

Uhm, the capital efficiency threshold,

the competitive saturation paradox, the franchise-in-a-box operating system.

Let's see what I said about this one. This mechanism focuses more on how

the solution works rather than why they're stuck. While it addresses their overwhelm with

scattered information, it doesn't create the paradigm shift that the higher rate mechanisms provide.

It's more tactical than transformational. The automated hospitality engine.

I did like this idea, to be fair. And they have it at number

8. Similar to the franchise mechanism,

this is more about the solution delivery than problem diagnosis.

While it addresses the fear of creating another time-consuming job,

it doesn't explain the deeper reasons for their past failures.

And it's probably fair. And then the capital multiplier at number 9.

Okay. So, what we can do is,

you know, we'll just say,

we'll just keep that in mind for now. So we had,

we had the asset gap versus income gap,

permission-based income, digital serfdom,

active or passive. Let's see what chat GPT says.

So I asked it the same prompt, thought for 2 minutes and 49 seconds,

using O3 Pro. So

it had asset gap versus income gap,

asset control method. Um,

which is very interesting.

And guess what number 2 was? Permission-based income trap.

Is that really, to me, that's, it's fascinating.

Cause like those were like my favorite ones. And it gives you sort of

pros and cons, right? So why do,

why does it like the asset gap versus income gap?

Refrains the prospect's core frustrations. I need a higher paycheck.

Has the wrong diagnosis and reveals the missing piece.

They have an asset gap, not an income gap. Turns rental arbitrage into the

first believable bridge from. Labor to asset ownership without banks or big down payments,

mapping perfectly to their desire to build wealth through real estate without mortgages,

immediately differentiates the offer from every side hustle or make money pitch they've already

tried key URB pain point links.

I don't know what those are. Many of us watch out,

so must keep the math simple and concrete, avoid abstract econ jargon.

Number two, permission-based income trap. Permissionless cashflow system speaks straight

to the autonomy control pain. Bosses, algorithms,

client control, main income gives a single memorable villain,

permission-based income, and a clear escape route requiring only one negotiated.

These evokes take back control. Be your own boss language.

The testing shows this market loves,

um,

needs strong proof that landlord agreements truly are a one and done to overcome

fear of eviction, legal issues. Cool.

Then add the Capital Multiplier Framework.

Now for Quad, they put that as number 5.

Chatspeak data is number 3. Uh,

obliterates the capital barrier objection up front and price of real estate,

promises escape velocity, rolling cashflow funds to the next unit,

which taps their hunger for momentum and fire-style compounding,

uses the sticky phrase ownership fallacy to explain why past advice failed.

And then for number 4,

Capital Efficiency Threshold, which Quad had,

wait a second, Capital Multiplier Framework,

you know, sorry, Quad had, the efficiency thing is 5,

and the multiplier is number 9, so that was different.

But if I'm looking at this, and I'd ask it in digital search.

I would them down here, uhm,

and it is worth, like, seeing, right, like, okay,

so like, I like this digital search thing,

what does it not like about it? Medieval metaphor made polarizer feel more dramatic

in shorter ad formats. So that's valid,

right? So that's why I ranked it lower. So I still, like, liked it,

it's just that it feels like in shorter ad formats, uhm,

it might be hard to pull that off. Maybe not, though.

Again, I still like it, but, uhm,

you know, that's a valid criticism. And then I,

like I said, I like the automated hospitality engine, which I had,

quad hat as number 8, this one has it as 6.

Direct handout on the time, burnout pain, I don't want another job,

pacing attractive end state, strong differentiator for skewer courses that leave opposite students,

works best after they believe arbitrage is viable,

at problem aware stage it can sound like a software demo.

And I think that's valid, that's something I mentioned where,

like, it was talking more to problem aware people,

uhm,

or sorry,

more like solution aware people, this is more problem aware, right? Uhm,

but, you know, I kind of like this,

How does saturation paradox ever look? Although it's very much,

I agree that that would be more for a solution aware market.

Least urgent for problem aware prospects,

they haven't seen an arbitrage, so saturation is in front of mind.

Keep for deeper funnel retargeting, right? Okay,

cool. How to use this ranking.

All right,

so, kind of cool. We're already seeing Claude and ChatTVT both agree on the

top two. What about Gemini?

So, same exact prompt,

Gemini. Number

one, the permission-based income trap.

We have permission-based income trap as,

there's number two for Claude and ChatTVT,

number one for Gemini. This mechanism is ranked highest due to its profound emotional

resonance and stability to unify all of the targets in the market's frustrations under

a single powerful concept. Core idea,

the process financial struggle stemmed from the fact that all their income sources from

their nine-to-five jobs to their failed side hustles are permission-based,

meaning they're dependent on the whims of a boss,

a client, or a platform algorithm.

The solution is to build a permissionless cashflow system where they are finally in

control. Connection to the problem where market diagnoses a core emotional

pain. The research brief report repeatedly highlights additional desperation to escape the soul-sucking nine-to-five

grind and a feeling of powerlessness in their current employment situation.

This mechanism gives that feeling a name, validating their experience that they lack control

over the time, schedules, and life decisions. Reframes all the past failures.

It brilliantly explains why their jobs feel like a trap and why their attempts

at gig work, freelancing, and job shipping felt just as precarious.

It shows them that even when working for themselves, they were never truly controlled,

but were instead at the mercy of platforms that could shut them down overnight,

offers the ultimate promise. The deepest desires of this market is complete,

or the deepest desire is complete autonomy and the ability to take back control.

The permissionless cashflow system is a direct and powerful promise that delivers on this

exact dream. Verdict. This mechanism is the most potent because it focuses on the

psychological root of the prospect's pain,

a lack of control, which is even deeper than their financial frustration.

And then number two had the asset gap versus the income gap and digital

serfdom. So kind of curious how they combined it.

This is a very close second trading some of the raw emotional power of

the permission angle for paradigm shifting intellectual insight that is perfectly tailored to this

audience. Core idea. The prospect has been trying to solve an asset gap problem,

not owning cash flowing assets with a net income gap solution,

trying to earn more from labor. Their past failure in online businesses were a

form of digital serfdom, but it took all the risk while platform lords like

Google and Shopify reap the rewards from the true assets,

the platform data. The solution is asset control arbitrage,

which allows them to gain control of a real physical asset without the prohibitive

cost of ownership. So it's kind of interesting. Um,

Gemini liked income gap number two,

but it kind of, uh, worked in the serfdom idea,

which is kind of neat connection to the problem or market.

Obviously we're thinking it respects their intelligence by introducing a sophisticated economic concept that

perfectly explains their feeling of being in a big economic system.

It shows them why trying to make more money through dropshipping or freelancing was

preordained to fail at building wealth. Perfectly reframes online failures.

The digital serfdom concept is a masterful reframe masterful reframe with their past losses

and dropshipping. It gives them an external enemy,

the platform lords, and explains why their lord or why their hard work resulted

in so little equity control. Connection directly to real estate dreams.

The market wants real estate exposure but feels priced out.

This mechanism presents rental arbitrage not as just another side hustle,

but as a legitimate and savvy entry point into real estate investing,

bridging the gap between their desire and the financial reality.

First, this mechanism is incredibly powerful for making the prospect feel enlightened.

It provides the aha moment that explains why their past efforts were flawed at

a structural level, positioning the product as a fundamentally different and superior path forward.

Number three, they had the capital efficiency threshold.

Number four, the competitive saturation paradox.

Uhm,

see, this is good, like, exceptionally well crafted,

but is likely aimed at the wrong awareness level for a primary hook.

Number five, franchise is in the box,

you know, it's good, but doesn't offer new diagnosis of the prospect's core problem.

And it didn't, for whatever reason, it kind of ignored some of the other

ones. Uhm, so it just really didn't like them or something.

But,

given this, you kind of know at the very least what your top two

to go with are. And I would just tell you from my experience,

I agree. And frankly, I don't I'm also pretty torn on

which one I would go with.

Now,

if you really needed help, you could do this.

You could download quad rankings,

Gemini rankings, ChatGPT rankings,

whatever it is, right? And then,

above them each, like, here's the rankings for a unique mechanism,

you know, based on this, which one seems like the most likely,

you know, would you pick, right? Uhm,

that's one thing you can do. Other thing you can do,

,is use the quad project. So let me show you,

...that map. Give me a moment.

...I open a quad project for unique

mechanisms. I taught this, ...it's like a bonus in a bundle I did a

while ago. It's still really helpful.

But what we're gonna be doing right now, the reason it's helpful,

,is because, by the way, if you're seeing this, this was actually,

,where we had, had it come up with mechanisms,

and I tested doing it, and, ...that quad project.

Uhm,

,but again, the mechanisms weren't actually that good. They're okay,

but not great.

,but what we're trying to do here is not necessarily get our final,

...copy format, though we could end up with something pretty close to it.

What we, ...want to really do here is,

,we want to see what our mechanism could look like in real,

...like, in real copy,

right? If it was sort of in the wild, in a video sales letter,

for example, right? Because, by the way, in ads and other things like that,

some ads, video ads, will have a long mechanism anyway.

They're still gonna talk about this, what have you. So,

it's just a way to help, because honestly, as you flesh it out,

and you look at this one, and we'll do the same thing for the

other, ,our other top UMP competitor,

...it might help push you over the edge on which one to choose.

Because it's hard. I mean, it really is hard. Honestly,

the answer would be, ...test both.

Ideally, if you're already in an existing business, you just test both in ads

and stuff, and you see which one is doing better,

right? And then you do the VSL after that.

But, if you're, ,you know,

doing something from scratch, ...and it's like a new product,

of course, ,coaching program, whatever, ,it's kind of tough,

right? ...the prompt here,

,we're going to do an in-depth, ...unique mechanism for a product.

I've attached a unified research document, ...that should give you a strong overview of

the target market. Here's the sum of the UMP and UMS.

This is just going to be, ,right,

whatever the, ...things you generated are that you want to kind of,

,play with. For this exercise,

let's specifically focus on people in the market who are problem aware.

I'm keeping that in there because I really want to speak to them.

Go and write this section in a format that could be used in a

video sales letter. Okay? You're obviously going to get access to this prompt.

So let's go ahead and do that. There we go.

And, ,I'm going to upload the,

uh, unified research document. One minute.

Okay. And let's see how Quad does

with it. And

honestly, once you understand this, you're going to be angry. Angry at yourself for

not seeing it sooner, and angry at everyone who's been selling you the wrong

solution at the wrong time. See, for the past few years,

you've been trying to solve what I call an asset gap problem with an

income gap solution, and that's why nothing has worked. Let me explain what I

mean. Right now, you're feeling the squeeze. Your paycheck stays the same while everything

else gets more expensive. Gas, groceries, rent, it's all going up while your salary

stays flat. You'll look at your bank account and think, I just need to

make more money. That seems logical, right? If money is tight,

make more money. Problem solved. So you start looking for side hustles.

Maybe you tried dropshipping, spent money on ads, and watched your products sit there

while your ad costs ate up any potential profit. Maybe you jumped into freelancing,

trading your nights and weekends for a few extra $100 a month.

Some of you might have even gotten into the gig economy. You're driving for

Uber, delivering food, anything to bring in extra cash.

What happened? You either lost money, barely broke even,

or you made just enough to feel like you were trading wins.

You got frustrated, burned out, and convinced yourself that maybe you're just not cut

out for this entrepreneur thing. But here's what nobody told you.

You were never solving the real problem. Remember when we looked at unique mechanisms

in the very first section? This is what it's doing,

right? The real problem isn't that you don't make enough money.

The real problem is that you're trapped on the wrong side of the economic

equation entirely. You see, there are two types of people in this economy.

There are people who trade their time for money, that's the income gap world,

and there are people who control assets that generate money. While they sleep,

that's the asset gap world. Every side hustle you tried has kept you firmly

planted in the income gap world.

Dropshipping, you're still trading your time,

managing suppliers, customer service, freelancing,

you're literally selling hours of your life. Gig work, same thing,

no work, no pay. The people who are actually building wealth,

the people who have true financial freedom, they've crossed over to the asset gap

world. Like,

one thing I don't know if I like that, sort of, you go from

the income gap to the asset gap. Like, does that make sense?

I don't know. But that could be changed,

right? We're just right now, we're just seeing how this feels as copy.

They control things and make money,

whether they're wickers, real estate businesses that run without them,

income producing assets. And here's the cool part.

The system is designed to keep you in the income gap world.

Banks won't give you a mortgage without perfect credit,

but 20% down. Invested properties will hire even more capital.

Private equity won't even talk to you unless you're already wealthy.

So you stay stuck grinding away at side hustles will never ever get you

where you want to be because you can't hustle your way into the asset

gap world. You need a different vehicle entirely. That's why I was so excited

when I discovered rental arbitrage because for the first time in my life,

I found a way to jump directly from the income gap world into the

asset gap world without needing hundreds of thousands of dollars of perfect credit.

Think about when you're master, when you master rental arbitrage,

you're not sure what you're trading time for money anymore. You're controlling a high

value asset, a residential property that generates cash flow month after month.

You're not the employee, you're the business owner. You're not selling your time.

You're leveraging someone else's asset to build your own wealth.

This is why rental arbitrage feels different from every other opportunity you've seen because

it's not income gap solution. It's not another income gap solution dressed up with

fancy markings. It's actually a bridge to the asset capital,

the world where real wealth gets built. The asset control method,

your bridge to the other side. So now you understand why everything else has

failed. Let me show you how the asset control method actually works.

Traditionally, real estate investing requires you to buy property,

which means massive down payments, perfect credit and making,

taking on enormous debt. But with the asset control method,

you gain operational control of a property without owning it.

Here's how it works. Instead of buying property, you lease it on a long-term

basis from a property owner who wants stable, reliable income without the headaches of

property management. You then operate that property as a short-term rental,

capturing the difference between what you pay in rent and what you earn from

guests. But here's the key insight that most people miss.

You're not just arbitraging rent prices. You're financially changing your position in the accounting.

You go from being someone who trades time for money to someone who controls

the cash flowing asset. When you wake up in the morning,

money has been deposited into your account from guests who stayed in your property

while you were sleeping. When you go on vacation, the property keeps sharing income.

When you want to scale, you need to find more houses in the hour,

you need to find more hours in the day. You just add more properties

to your portfolio. This is what it feels like to operate in the asset

capital. And the beautiful thing about rental arbitrage is that it requires a fraction

of the capital that traditional real estate demands.

We're talking about 5,000 to 15,000 to get started,

not $10,000, $100,000 or more. The property owner loves this range because they get

guaranteed rent, professional management, and none of the hassles of dealing with short term

guests. You love it because you're building a portfolio of cash flowing assets without

the enormous capital requirements of traditional real estate.

This is why rental arbitrage isn't just another side hustle.

It's a completely different category of opportunity. It's your ticket out of the income

gap road. And it's the asset gap road where real wealth gets built.

Once you understand this distinction, you'll never look at making more money the same

way again, because you'll realize that the goal isn't to make more money.

It's to control the asset that makes money for you.

Okay, one thing.

I'm wondering about going back to how it was written.

You're trying to solve an asset gap problem with an income gap solution,

right? Uhm.

I mean, one way I might try and, like, make it really clear is,

like.

I say this, right? This.

And again, we're not trying to get a final mechanism necessarily.

So,

I said,

I think

this

is great, but I wonder if it's really an income gap world versus,

or an asset gap Uh, let me show you how to bridge that gap.

I'm gonna go for the real, what I'm getting at here is I don't

know if moving to an asset gap world

makes sense. It's more like,

moving to, I'll show you what it is, and by the way, this is

where I'm still worthwhile, maybe,

moving, uhm,

asset bridge world. So it's like,

you've got, I

think you've got an income gap,

what you've really got is an asset gap.

This matters because you're trying to

solve to make more income,

but no one is really income rich.

People get rich from assets,

and they are asset rich.

Let's see another

version of the UMP that takes this into consideration.

So while it's doing that,

because without a doubt you're absolutely right. No,

it isn't actually, it's just going to revise it. It should have said you're

absolutely right. Let's test out the exact same prompt.

But with Gemini, without a project,

without permission, any of that stuff, right? And we'll also test it in

chatGBT. So let's go to Gemini.

We're going to upload our unified brief.

does. What's changed a lot with LLMs,

I feel like, is like, you don't really need to explain typically what a

video sales letter is, whatever, right? I mean,

I think there's value, again, I wouldn't, this is not me trying to write

final copy format. Sometimes it just comes out really good and you're like,

oh shit, basically I have it. But, it's more just seeing how it looks

in reality. I'm just curious how Gemini, if Gemini, I kind of feel like

a bad mistake from Quad, and I'm curious if Gemini makes that mistake too

or not. So, let's see. Meanwhile,

while that's writing, let's see what Quad's version here.

Oh,

wait, that's the wrong one. Then truth about why every site has those failed

you.

Okay, so this is kind of the same copy as before,

you're going to be angry. You see, for the past few years,

you've been trying to solve what I call an asset gap problem with an

income gap solution. And that's one of the things that works.

Let me explain. You're feeling squeezed. I think I need to make more money.

So, you're looking for side hustles. What happened?

But here's what nobody ever told you. You think you have an income problem,

but what you really have is an asset problem. Let me show you what

I mean. Think about the wealthiest people you know,

not the ones flashing money on social media, but the people with real,

lasting wealth. How many of them got rich from a paycheck?

Even the highest paid professionals, doctors, lawyers, executives,

most of them actually built a generational wealth. People aren't doing it from their

salaries alone, they're doing it by accumulating assets,

real estate, business, investments that generate money,

whether they're working or not. See, there's no such thing as being income rich

in the long run. Income is just what you trade your time for,

and you only have 24 hours in a But being asset rich, that's where

real wealth comes from. Assets make money while you sleep.

But here's the problem. Every solution you've been offered for your financial struggles has

been focused on the wrong thing. More income.

Start a side hustle, make an extra hundred. Make an extra thousand dollars a

month. Freelance your skills for extra cash. Drive for Uber in your spare time.

All income solutions. All requiring you to trade more of your time for money.

All keeping you trapped in the same cycle that got you here in the

first place. Meanwhile, the people who are actually building wealth are over here accumulating

assets, and the system makes it almost impossible for regular people like us to

get started. Want to buy a rental property? 20-25% down.

Perfect credit. Enough income to qualify for a mortgage that might be $300,000 or

more. Want to invest in commercial real estate? You need to be a credit

investor with serious capital. Want to start a business?

Most require significant upfront investments and years to become profitable.

So you stay stuck, grinding away at income solutions that will never,

ever bridge the gap to becoming asset rich. Because here's the harsh truth.

You can't earn your way to wealth. You have to own,

own your way to wealth. It's a good copy right there.

That's why I'm so excited I discovered rental arbitrage. Because for the first time

in my life, I found a way to earn to start accumulating cash flowing

assets without needing hundreds of thousands of dollars of perfect credit.

Uhm,

now you understand the real problem. You have an asset gap, not an income

gap. Let me show you how the asset control method actually works to resolve

it. Okay, so that's gonna do the rest of this.

So, I actually really like the mechanism now.

With this V2. That is a perfect example,

though, of Kind of judgment based

on experience that is really hard to,

like, teach. I mean,

maybe it was obvious to some of you when you were reading it.

Maybe it wasn't. It's okay either way. But,

that's something that I was able to pick up on based on putting it

in my hundred thousand hours,

right? I don't have to put it in my hundred thousand hours,

but however many it's been. But, let's see what happens.

What Gemini did here. Gemini

tends to do a little bit more direction, so let's see. You

That contact, nagging pressure, the squeeze.

You look at your paycheck, and you look at your bills, at the cost

of just living, and the math just doesn't work. You know you need to

make more money. That part is obvious. So,

you do what any smart, motivated person would do. You start a side hustle.

Maybe Maybe you got a freelancer, and you spend hours driving for a gig

economy app. You worked hard, you poured in time,

you really didn't have, hoping for that breakthrough, only to end up with a

few extra bucks that barely moved the needle. Or worse, you lost money on

courses and ads that promised to deliver nothing. And you're left feeling burned out,

frustrated, maybe even a little foolish. You start thinking, is it me?

Am I just not cut out for this? I'm here to tell you it's

not your fault. You haven't failed. You haven't failed.

Your strategy has. You've been trying to solve the wrong problem.

So, you even focused on what I call the income gap.

You correctly identified the symptom, that your income isn't keeping up with your expenses.

The logical conclusion is, I need more income.

But that's like putting a bandaid on a bullet wound. The extra hundred or

even thousand dollars a month from a side hustle doesn't change the fundamental game.

It doesn't stop the feeling of being trapped, or working harder,

and harder just to have less than your parents did. Why?

Because the real problem isn't the income gap, the real underlying disease is the

asset gap. This is the hidden barrier, the structural divide that keeps 99% of

people stuck. It's the gap between those who get paid for their time,

and those who build wealth from cash flowing assets. Think about it,

every side hustle you've tried, drop shipping, freelancing,

game work, they all required you to sell more of your time and your

labor. You were still just patching a leaking boat instead of building a new

one. You're trying to solve an asset gap problem with an income gap solution.

It was never going to work. It's like trying to win Formula 1 race

on a bicycle. The rigged economic system you feel isn't just about income but

stagnant wages. It's about being locked out of the world of assets.

The world where money starts working for you instead of you always working for

it. This is why traditional real estate feels impossible.

You know that property is the path to wealth, but who has a massive

down payment or a perfect credit score? You've been priced out of the single

most powerful asset class available. So you're stuck,

stuck in the income gap, staring across a chasm at the road of assets

with no bridge to get there until now. What if you could leapfrog the

income gap problem? Entirely. What if you cross that chasm and gain control over

a high value cashflow asset without needing hundreds of thousands of dollars to gain

a mortgage? This is the paradigm shift we've created.

We don't teach you another side hustle. We give you a strategic blueprint to

change your fundamental economic identity. We call it the asset control method.

This is the first system designed specifically for the person who has ambition but

lacks capital. It's a method that allows you to directly address the asset gap

through a unique approach to rental arbitrage. We show you how to control a

residential property, an asset, and operate it as a short-term rental.

You don't buy it. You don't need a bank loan. You don't need a

huge down payment. You fundamentally change your position in the economic food chain.

You stop being a seller of your own time, and you become the operator

of an asset that generates cash flow month after month. This isn't about making

extra money. This is about building a portfolio.

This is about generating passive income that provides real security.

It's about taking back control of your time,

your finances, and your life.

This is how you stop patching leaks and fallibility. Build a new boat, one

that can weather any storm, and carry you to the shore of financial freedom.

Okay, so, what are our thoughts here?

Uhm,

Gemini's was better than the first Quad output in

that it got it well.

What I don't think the copy was as good as Quad,

and this is why I tend to use Quad as copy, for copy.

especially Once we did V2,

Quad was better, uhm,

in my opinion. I think this copy's,

I, judgement, whatever you want to call it, Quad's better.

Uhm, and remember,

this could be close to file copy format,

but a lot of the ways I write VSLs,

which you'll be learning,

Don't have, don't, this will be the file format. Same thing for PDPs,

and then obviously having this to put into, like, ads,

advertorials, everything else. Uhm,

so a lot of what I do is sort of just modeling and structuring

off other swipes, essentially, right? It's always been kind of my thing,

but, uhm.

Yeah, so what am I gonna do?

Let me save these here.

I think you can't see my screen, I'm doing an arbitrage. Income

gap first. Asset gap.

I mean,

I'll do it here so you can see, watch me typing. Okay, right,

just quad version. Let's

do it, just quad combo. Quad v2.

The reason I'm doing v2 is I don't really know what I'm wasting my

time copy pasting v1 in here. You can go look at the quad combo,

I'll put a link in there. And let's do Gemini 2.5

Pro. So what I'm going to do.

There we go. Oops, copy link.

Okay, there we go. Quad combo here.

Quad v2. We're

going to copy and paste. Into

our document. so

we'll dot It'll track it.

We'll go do Gemini. I don't

really need the speaker notes for time, whatever.

I'm probably going to command shift v this one,

so it's not as annoying.

Okay,

so now we have that, right? Super duper.

And,

you know, we'll have a training on how to create these cloud projects. But

as you can see, you don't, I mean, it's still helpful. I actually do

like it for writing, but it's not the most crucial.

You must have this thing. Let's do that

same prompt,

but with the other mechanism. We

had the other one we liked a lot. What's permission-based income

trap? So now.

Okay, same stuff here.

Copy and paste. Re-copy this.

Now we're going to copy in our permission-based

income trap one. But like,

you know. I'll

format this and make it all pretty later. I

said that, but then it's going to bother me if I don't do it

now. Let's

run the same thing. One in quad.

I'm going to upload my unified research document again.

One question. Hey Stefan,

could you just upload it in the same conversation history?

Probably, but I like to keep it clean. So,

I'm doing it here instead, okay? Run this one with quad.

Let's go to Gemini. Same thing. And let's run it in Gemini as well.

I need to search for some current information about rental arbitrage to make sure

the mechanism is grounded in an accurate up-to-date context. Now let's search for information.

Did I tell it to do deep research? No. So,

let's see if Clog got weirdly woke on this one for some reason.

Let's find out. Uh,

rental arbitrage unique mechanism. Permission-based income trap.

Now before I show you exactly how this works, I need to share something

with you that most people are struggling financially and never realize.

There's a hidden reason why you keep feeling trapped no matter how hard you

work or how many different things you try to make extra money.

It's not because you're lazy, it's not because you lack skills or intelligence,

and it's definitely not because you're not trying hard enough. The real problem is

something I call the permission-based income trap. See here's what I discovered after helping

hundreds of people break free from financial stress. Every single income source that's keeping

you stuck has one thing in common. Your ability to earn money is completely

dependent on someone else's permission. Think about it for a second.

Your day job? You need your boss's permission to keep earning that paycheck.

They can fire you tomorrow and your income disappears overnight. That side hustle you

tried with Uber or DoorDash? Your earnings are controlled by an algorithm that can

change without warning, cutting your income potential in half just because some programmer decided

to tweak the code. Maybe you tried freelancing or consulting.

Every dollar you make requires a client's permission to continue the contract.

The moment they decide to go with someone else, that income stream vanishes.

Or perhaps you got into dropshipping or affiliate marketing like so many people do.

Your entire business was built on Facebook. Facebook's or Google's permission to run your

ads. And we all know how that story ends. Accounts get shut down overnight

and entire businesses disappear in an instant. And even if you tried getting a

second job or picking up extra shifts, you're still asking for your manager's permission

to work more hours. You see the pattern here? In every single case,

you're not really in control of your income. You're always asking permission to earn

a living. Here's the brutal truth.

When your income depends on someone else's permission, you face constant income instability.

No job security, and you're always one decision away from financial disaster.

This is why you can work for 60 hours a week and still feel

like you're falling behind. Why you can hustle harder than everyone else around you

and still struggle to get ahead. And why every time you think you've found

a solution, it ends up being just another trap that keeps you dependent on

someone else's permission. The permission-based income trap explains why over a third of Americans

believe they'll always need a side hustle just to make ends meet.

You're stuck in this endless cycle of chasing permission-based income that can take you

away at any moment. But here's what gets me really frustrated.

Most financial advice completely ignores this fundamental problem.

They tell you to diversify your income streams or build multiple revenue sources,

but if all your income streams still require someone else's permission,

you haven't solved anything. You've just created multiple ways to lose your income.

The permissionless cash flow system, right? The good news is there's a unique way

out of this trap, and it's simpler than you might think. Instead of building

more permission-based income streams, what if you could create what I call a permissionless

cash flow system. This is a business model where,

after a one-time setup, your income flows directly from your open market to your

bank accounts, without needing anyone's ongoing permission to keep earning.

No boss can fire you from it, no algorithm can suddenly slash your earnings,

no client can decide to stop paying you, no platform can shut you down,

can shut down your account and destroy your business overnight. The income,

and it's not really true for Airbnb, right? The income is generated by real

people in the free market who want what you're offering in return.

And the money flows directly to Now, you may be thinking,

that sounds impossible. Every business needs customers.

Customers have to choose you, right? You're absolutely right,

but here's the key difference. In a permissionless cashflow system,

you're not dependent on one boss's decision, one algorithm's preference,

one client's mood, or one platform's policy.

Instead, you're tapping into a massive, consistent demand from thousands of potential customers who

are actively searching for exactly what you're offering.

And the beautiful thing about this particular system is that it leverages something most

people don't have. Most people even realize exists. There are over 7 million listings

on Airbnb alone, and hosts collectively earned 180 billion dollars in 2024.

But here's what's fascinating. Most people think you need to own property to tap

into this market. That's not true. What I'm about to show you is completely

legal. Airbnb actually allows it, and it works in cities across the country.

It's called rental arbitrage, and here's how it creates your permissionless cashflow system.

You secure a strategic partnership with a property owner. This is the only point

where you need someone's permission. Thank you. But like a boss or client,

this isn't an ongoing permission. It's a legal agreement that gives you what I

call a master key to an income-producing asset. Once you have this master key,

everything changes. You set up the property as a short-term rental and list it

on platforms where millions of travelers are actively searching for exactly what you're offering.

Now here's where it gets beautiful. Your income isn't dependent on your boss's mood

or company's budget cuts, an algorithm deciding to favor you or oppress you,

a single client's decision to renew your contract, a platform's terms of service changes.

Instead, your income comes from the consistent demand of travelers who need a place

to stay. Business travelers, vacationers,

people relocating for work, they're all actively searching and booking accommodations every single day.

Once someone books your property, the money goes directly into your account.

No middleman deciding whether you deserve to get paid.

No boss determining your hourly rate. No algorithm calculating how much you're worth.

Just direct payments from the free market to your bank account.

Because short-term rentals can generate 15-35% profit margins,

you are not just replacing your permissionless based income,

you're potentially exceeding But here's the part that really excites me about

this system. Unlike

your job, where you trade time for money, or gig work, where you're constantly

hustling for the next order,

once your property is set up and listed, it works for you 24 7.

People can discover it, book it, and pay you while you're sleeping,

spend time with your family, or even stay at your next property.

This is how you break free from the permissionless Uh,

based income trap, and finally take back control of your financial future.

You're not asking anyone for permission to earn a living anymore.

You're providing value in the free market, and the market rewards you directly.

Okay, that's pretty damn good. So,

one of my 5 billion documents I had here,

let's go ahead and do, Oh,

and I'll format this later.

Number 2, uh,

what are we calling this one again? That's the permission or something,

we'll just see. Apparition based income strategy. Apparition.

Cloud Convo. Cloud

V1.

Okay, so Cloud Convo link. I'm gonna copy.

Alright, publish.

Alright, I'm gonna share a link to this one, because it is,

like, an artifact, which is really weird. I don't know.

I still don't know what the hell that does with clouds, so for now

I'm just gonna copy and paste the link. To this one.

Let's look at Gemini real

quick. Okay.

It's funny how it has

a similar, uh, kind of thing there. You feel it, don't you? Uhm. What

if the problem isn't you?

I know I'm skipping down a little

bit, because it's not the you feel it,

don't you thing again. It's kind of interesting. What if the problem isn't you?

What if the problem is that every single way you try to make money

has a fatal flaw, a hidden trap that ensures you never get fully ahead?

That's what permission-based income trap. Think about it.

You need your boss's permission, your permission, uhm,

so this is a lot shorter. It would be fine if I needed it,

but Claude, I think, did a really good job. So,

like, I personally am not even willing to pay much attention to what Gemini

gave me, okay? So,

let's bold this,

at least I have it. Which one do you choose?

Because V2 of what Claude did for the first

one, the income asset gap thing, was really

good. The answer is,

I honestly don't know. Do you want the complete truth?

I don't know. Uhm,

if I were me, if I was really writing a VSL for this,

what would I probably do? I probably would Again,

if you are sophisticated and able to do this,

you can test both hooks, both ideas and ads and advertorials,

whatever it is, if it was for an existing offer, that's what I would

probably do. If I was writing this for scratch,

for something brand new, I would probably sleep on it,

and ask a few people, like my wife, other people,

hey, which one do you like more? Which one resonates with you more?

Explain both to them and get their input or answers.

Uhm,

and then I would just make a decision based on my intuition and gut.

If you don't feel confident doing that, then I'd probably just go with number

one. I'd say what Google, two of the three LMs picked the income asset

gap as number one.

Probably aren't going to go wrong with that, I would pick that one.

The other thing to keep in mind is like,

The permission-based income trap did have

potentially more objections. Because it's sort of like,

oh, it can't change the platform, you know. You're not asking for permission,

but it's like you kind of are. You're still serving at the leisure of

Airbnb. So I have more objections with the income,

the permission-based one. I still really like it. I still might even fire it.

Frankly, we're writing this to try to work some of this into the VSL

as well. But maybe not as in-depth.

So I'd probably, gun to my head,

go with this one, to be honest with you.

But,

it's close.

And that's okay. Maybe, maybe both will work.

So maybe you don't have to agonize over the decision.

Maybe there's not one perfect mechanism. Yes, maybe one is better than the other,

but maybe a bunch of those mechanisms will work.

It can be, yeah, it'll be okay. So,

at this point we basically have copy, ready,

UMP, UMS stuff, right? What I'm going to do

in the rest of the mechanism module, I'm going to end this video in

a moment, is I'm going to do

some more examples, uhm, at least one more,

by skin care. Maybe do another one for golf,

or whatever it is. Uhm,

won't be too as long in those videos, probably. So,

hopefully you've watched this one. And,

uh, then we'll continue on to additional sections,

too. I will have, make sure to have a quick video about how to

set up that cloud project for you,

also. Alright, hopefully this has been mind-blowing.

Thank you.
