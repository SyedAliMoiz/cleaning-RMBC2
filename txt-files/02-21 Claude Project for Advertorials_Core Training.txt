Hello everybody. So,

right now in this video we are going to be going through the Clod

project strategy. Or really,

not a strategy, but just using Clod projects to produce pretty

much unlimited advertorials.

Right now I'm in my Clod project setup.

You can see that advertorial. Advertorial generation is what I called it.

You could call it, you know, the advertorial generator or whatever other cool

thing you wanted. You can see I use this pretty often.

Uhm, always in spurts when I'm needing advertorials.

But it's a really helpful, valuable project and you'll see some

of the assets here. Uhm, and you probably will see a lot of health

things, but don't worry as I will show you in this video.

you can see here of this and I'm not going to show you this

one, but, uhm, there are,

this works for any niche or category.

And I'll prove that to you in this video,

so I'm not going to go super deep in this video into like

what is an advertorial because I will have done that in a other trainings,

uh, within RMBC too.

In fact, very much in depth today.

I want to focus primarily on this cloud project and give you what you

need to set one up and then show you it in

real time as well as some previous examples too.

So as with all cloud projects,

you're literally just going to projects.

Once you're in cloud, you're hitting new project.

You're gonna name it and you're gonna say what you're trying to achieve.

So I'm going to give you this prompt. Uh,

in this case, I basically just did the same.

What am I trying to achieve and the instructions?

So I will be giving you different sales pages,

landing pages, product details. Are relevant data points and you will then be writing

new advertorials based off the numerous examples that are in your knowledge base.

What you'll want to do is analyze the structure of the various advertorial examples,

and then synthesize that knowledge and use that same knowledge along with your judgment

to produce new advertorials. Okay.

So we'd enter that in. I'm gonna go back to my project since I

have, uh, that here.

Okay. And it's exactly what I just said.

And if you go to the project knowledge,

you can do instructions, right? And in this case,

the set of project instructions are just the exact same thing as what the,

um, description is.

That's not always the case, but it's the case in this one.

Okay, so then with cloud projects.

As usual,

and I'm going to shoot all of these videos on RMBC2 for cloud projects,

assuming somebody didn't watch, really,

the other ones. Uh, hopefully you have,

you know, but, I,

you know, if it becomes repetitive as you go through all of RMBC2,

you know, I apologize. But at the same time, I just want to make

sure that anyone goes to any of these specific module.

They're not like, what, this is too advanced or over my head or not

detailed enough, whatever it is, okay? So as of all cloud projects,

you know, the key is really the knowledge base that you can have.

So what I've done here is I've uploaded a bunch of advertorial

examples. And I did them of sort of different lengths,

right? Because as we'll be covering in other modules of the advertorial

section of RMBC2, there are short,

medium, and long advertorials, right?

So what I did is I just went through the

internets and found a

bunch of advertorials. And then for each one,

I created a Google Doc originally.

I linked to the advertorial, so if it's still,

you know, live, I have it. But I also recognized,

you know, there's a chance that the advertorial will get taken

down. So let me make sure I save,

like, a screenshot, a copy of it too,

right? So,

you know, this one, cardiologist reveals lazy way to lose weight.

Hey, that's a cool hook. Let's see, is it still active? Hold up a

second, let's see, is this a load? Maybe.

Not still active, right? Well, no problem, that's why I saved it.

Do the same thing with this hearing aid thing,

which is more like a, you know,

device versus a fitness product.

I do have a few examples here. I have in here of advertorials as

well, that are, like, sort of more straightforward.

You know, there's a home shower upgrade,

right? Um, no more long shower renovations,

try this instead. And it's about,

you know, shower remodeling. I've added one in here as well.

Let me get to it. Neck

pain pillow, which is also sort of, you know, not a,

uh, consumable. I thought I had one in here as well,

about, um.

Like, sort of a, more of like a, a listicle one,

but maybe that's not in here for now. Let me just make sure all

of them uploaded, though. I'll double check that, give me a second.

Okay, I guess that's not, but. Let me make sure that in here.

Okay, I guess I didn't have, I thought I had another one in here

that was more of like a lead gen advertorial.

But again, I don't think, it shouldn't matter based on the experience.

Really, and here, here's an important point to understand right out of the gate,

which is, this has been true and I think I've really intuitively grasped this

from the very beginning. With, uh,

large language models and AI is the content is

not as important as the structure or like the

syntax, right? And when I say syntax definition,

right, the arrangement of words and phrases to create well-formed sentences in a language.

And so, what I really am trying to explain with that is when you

look at anything, like, let's go look at, like, a sort of click-baity thing,

like, you know, I mean that, uh,

you know, Dr. One that I opened earlier,

what was that here? Uh,

right here. Like, this is, again, you know, an ED one,

right? One trick that can eliminate ED in less than half an hour to

zero minutes before bed, right? Um,

researchers in the U.S. have finally developed a simple at-home treatment to help eliminate

ED, right? Some aggressive,

quick-banky, ED offer,

whatever. does not matter you could use this same structure

the same sort of like where there's like,

okay, a big curiosity hook, right?

Some statistic about people suffering from a pain point,

a line of dimensionalization about the pain point,

a line saying that experts have found a simple at-home solution for the pain

point. Call to action to watch a video and explain why you may not

have heard of this solution before, right?

Click here. Click here to watch. So, like, that's all that's happening in this

advertorial, right? And so you might be like,

well, I'm, this is too aggressive. I sell,

like, floral arrangements and bouquets,

uh, you know, through, like, uh,

you know, I could deliver to people, right?

Like, so this would never work for me. It's like, it totally would.

Actually, it'd be great, you know? Um,

it'd be like, one,

you know, uh,

I think I'm going to do something off the,

I'm going to riff here, right? But, um,

you know, the one,

this one game changing, uh,

one game changing app or,

like, website that delivers,

you know, custom bouquets and floor arrangements to your house in

less than, within 24 hours,

right? Like, uh, try it today. Okay?

That's not the perfect headline, but that's sort of a similar structure, right? Like,

You know,

if you're one of the 30 million guys,

or the actual status, right? We get the real data,

but, um, who plans to order flowers

for their wife this month, you probably figured,

found how frustrating it is, or how overwhelming the entire process can be,

from picking and arranging an arrangement to the crazy prices,

right? This can leave you delaying

getting your wife a special someone,

a gift that would be so meaningful to her,

and ultimately even lead to more stress and tension in your,

you know, relationship, right? Uhm,

after experiencing these issues firsthand for years and seeing

how frustrated guys are, uh,

one forest finally developed a revolutionary on-demand

floral arrangement service that fixes this

problem and gets flowers to your front door in less than,

you know, 24 hours. Uh,

you know, and so watch the video, like, you know,

check out, see how it works here and why big

companies like 1-800-Flowers hate that this service exists,

okay? Again, not the world's best copy ever,

but from the top of my head, not bad either. Um,

but did you see, I mean, that's what you see, right, how, so that's

what I'm talking about when I say the structure and the syntax,

because it's like, you see this and you think,

oh my goodness, like, well, that, you know,

I'm not doing any of the, one of the biggest things that you can

do to improve and as a marketer,

copywriter, really effective person in the world of business

is being able to extract out You And

so to take something like this and then not

immediately go, like, think about from a, like, no, that's not what I do.

It's like, yeah, it doesn't matter. What's the structure?

What's the syntax? And that's, I think why I love AI and LLM so

much is because that's what they do. Like, the structure and syntax doesn't matter.

Now, this is just one example of an advertorial, but I bring it up

because I have a bunch of these advertorials and the cloud project,

some of them are more aggressive, like that one. Some of them are more

non-aggressive. I mean,

ED is an aggressive category, so I think, and it says eliminate ED,

so it's like a little aggressive unless it was going to like Viagra or

Cialis, and it's probably not. It's probably going to some supplement,

right? But like, you know,

like, no more long shower renovations.

Try this instead, right? For this one, it's like, okay,

that's not aggressive. But like, it doesn't,

it doesn't matter, it's a syntax. And the other important thing with cloud projects,

especially this sort of methodology for cloud projects,

we'll look at some other methodologies where you're swiping more explicitly for like a

single individual structure, like for BSLs, for example,

whatever it is. But with advertorials in general,

uhm,

we just want to give it several samples or examples,

let it sort of pull from those for references,

and then use its judgment, okay?

So, we've uploaded all these here, I will give you all these advertorial PDFs.

You can 100%, uh,

experiment, and I would encourage you to do that with everything in this course.

Like, try what I do first, and then try your own version.

If you want to try other advertorials, uh, you can.

I do think versioning is variety is good. For example,

if you were selling a diet

program, I would really strongly recommend not doing a bunch of

diet weight loss advertorials, uhm,

because I don't want clodded LLMs to just only try to pull from those

things. I want to actually have to work harder by having to pull from

a variety of different,

uh, subjects, categories,

as it's going. And,

again, in another module, I'll be sharing,

you know, in depth how to go find advertorials, etc.

But, you know, just as a quick note, if you, and again,

this will also be another video, but, like, uh,

I did an example of let's see like Wichita,

Kansas news, right? Let's just do that, okay?

Like, really, if you just type in, pick random cities,

pick news sites, let's do this one first,

okay? I don't like the sites that are all videos,

really, but hopefully this isn't going to be a video-heavy one.

Let's see here. Kind of makes me sad how all the news sites are

videos. Ugh,

I'm trying to pause that and not click on the ad. Alright,

let's see, does this website have it? Yep,

here you go, right? You always have it from around the web,

right? So here's a bunch of skincare ones. Uh,

50 plus women swore by this age-defying vitamin C serum,

which is, by the way, totally a ship-off for vitamin C serum.

She tossed five products and trusted one,

here's what happened. Let's see what we have here. Crepe skin,

MD solutions won't tighten crepe skin.

So let's see, right? If I click this, click this,

click this. However, you know, advertorial. Advertorial. Advertorial. What's funny

is I think somebody sent me this advertorial yesterday,

actually. And so, I probably will swipe it, sort of. For,

uh,

my beauty brand later, right? But,

okay, cool. If I want those, I could just use a screen capture of

them. Or I can just copy and paste it,

even easier, right? Ctrl A,

Ctrl C, and do Google Doc.

Do that, add to my advertorial swipe file.

So it's really easy to have, like, an endless advertorial swipe file.

Just go to different local news sites. Maybe go incognito,

because you will see, like, sort of get,

if you're clicking on a bunch of, of, like, I, like, I did this

as an example. I clicked on a bunch of hearing aid advertorials,

and then everything I was seeing was hearing aid. Right now,

I'm doing a lot of beauty for my beauty brand,

so that might be why I'm seeing all of these. So you can go

incognito, use a different browser, whatever, to see if you can get served different

advertorials based on what browser you have.

But this is how you can get a whole massive swipe file.

So, again, we'll do that more in a different video. Right now,

I want to stay fairly simple. I'm fairly focused here, um,

I mean, I kind of want to save these, but I am going to

save them. Give me just a moment here. Okay,

cool. I saved those for myself. Now, again,

I have a habit of doing that, too, by the way, right? If you

see interesting stuff, just save them. I use Evernote sometimes.

You can just use a Google Doc, Notepad,

whatever it is, but just saving links. But I would also recommend,

typically, copying and pasting,

or doing a screenshot. I've been using this tool here,

Markup Hero. Um,

you can kind of select a segment, you can scroll and do an entire

page, you can do the visible tab, but I think that's the least useful.

Um, you can, you know,

but I just think it's helpful, especially because these days with LMs,

they have, like, machine, you know, the vision, right? So,

they can analyze pictures. So, I'm going I mean,

I do, like, I don't know, dozens of screenshots a day, at least dozens,

right? Um,

but anyway, we've got, you know, our avatars,

which you're going to get in this training.

You've got your quad project, so it's like,

now it's time to communicate with it, right?

So,

it's pretty simple prompts, right? Here's a blank.

For a blank, please analyze it,

and then I want you to give me 10 potential hooks for avatars we

could write. There's also going to be separate trainings on hooks,

but for now, let's let Claude do the magic.

This is how I actually use it normally, right?

So, like, here's a,

here's a landing page, or here's the landing page copy for a skincare

product. Please analyze it, give me 10 potential hooks for avatars we could write.

Here's a, you know,

PDF, uhm,

with details for a new consumer

device, please analyze it, give me 10 potential avatars we could write.

Here's a

video sales letter script for a Airbnb

arbitrage coaching program, please analyze it,

give me 10 potential hooks for avatars we could write.

Okay, so basically, prompt one is like,

you give it the document for analysis, you tell it,

ask it to give you hooks, we'll do this live in a minute,

two is like, okay, great, like, once you pick a hook you like,

can you write an outline for that, give it a length you want,

right, a blank length avatar,

uhm, I usually will add this in just to be safe because I don't

want to reveal the price, unless you do want to reveal the price,

that's one of the reasons this is highlighted, sometimes you might reveal the price

in an advertorial, but often you won't, uhm,

cool, let's write the advertorial. This is,

to be honest with you, not needed, Claude finally does it where it runs

out of space, you just push the button and say to keep going,

but you can still use it. So I'll just show you what it looks

like, but first we need something to look at,

right? So, let's do that.

So I saw an ad earlier today for this

company Norse Organics, uhm, honestly you can see it's got like 1100

results, uhm,

they had a really good static ad that hit me,

that that was interesting, uhm,

they talk about acne scars,

get rid of acne, all these things,

right, so these guys are just testing tons of creatives,

they're testing statics, they're testing visuals,

uhm,

or videos, they actually do more statics, it seems like only lately they've started

trying to test more videos, uhm,

so it's like, okay, it's pretty cool.

So I don't know, this is probably going to go to Navatorial, I would

guess, but let's see.

Let's go ahead and click on it, uh,

no, actually, I hate this font, this one's for teens,

okay, I want to pay full price,

that's not bad, I used to see there's other landing pages that aren't for

teens, that'll be interesting to see too. Let's go to,

Nope,

they focus on acting for teens, okay,

no problem. Life-changing,

I was very skeptical, you're a little boy.

I'm curious about this, what I'm curious about, you have to bear with me

here, is that when she was talking about her son,

right? This

clearly was, like, a really, uh,

a winning piece of ad, you know, we're not doing meta ads here, but

I'll probably come back to this one for, like, when I do the meta

ads trainings, because, like, do you see how often they're using this copy here?

this is a big winner for them. Oh my god,

so much, must have been a huge winner for them, right, by the fact

the amount of stuff they're doing here. Jeez louise,

that must have just really crushed for them, which is interesting, right, I would

totally be swiping this. Oh my god,

clearly, that's, it's crazy when you think about how it's,

like, the same copy for so many ads,

like, can I just do the meta ad module now to talk about this

one, I have so many thoughts, but I don't want to,

I don't want to go down a rabbit hole, I want to keep this

kind of concise. It's

weird saying your little boy deserves skin, because it's only,

I guess, it's just really targeted towards men,

okay. So, it is what it is,

but fine, okay. Now,

in the case of this, let's try a copy. I'm copying, like, the whole

thing, Ctrl A. Now,

I'm going to create a new Google Doc. Let's see.

I'm going to save it as a PDF, and I'm going to find out,

I mean, if the file is, like, too massive for Quad,

then, okay, we'll do something else. But let's try it as

a PDF. So, it's, like, uh,

Norse Acne PDF,

okay? I'm going to download

it, PDF document.

Okay, it's downloaded. Let's go here,

and let's copy and paste this, copy this prompt.

Let's paste it into here. So,

here is, uh,

landing page copy for a,

know,

Acne product.

I don't need to give more details than that. Please analyze it for me,

10 bucks would be great for an advertorial, right?

Okay, cool. Now I'm gonna upload the PDF, one second.

Okay, it's uploading, hopefully this isn't like a massive file,

megabyte-wise. If not, I might try to change it, uh,

to be a less big file, because there are a lot of images.

Seems like it's okay. It uploaded, cool.

First thing we want is 10 bucks. Now,

one really point, important, distinguish,

oh my god, I can't talk. One important distinction I would probably make is

that if I knew that angle about,

I don't usually talk about this, blah, blah, blah, like,

clearly it's like a big banger for them. So I would probably consider

You know, one of the advertorials I do being

really congruent with this, right,

could probably do well for them, frankly. Because,

like, they tell this whole story and it goes to the page,

the page is kind of congruent, but, like,

could be better, right? So, once they even remark this,

we might come back to this, okay? But right now,

we gave it the advertorial, give me 10 hooks.

That we could write, okay? I'm using Clawd for Sondra right now.

So Clawd's

gonna do its magical thinking, we're gonna hang out while it does it. But

Clawd, ponder. Here's

potential hooks. Forty

Years of Failure hook. The Hidden Acme

Truth hook. The Viking Secret hook.

This one's kind of interesting.

This

one's kind of one clearly is very congruent with what they actually do.

The Arctic Discovery hook. Scientists discovered these rare arctic plants destroy acne bacteria three

times faster than prescriptions. Uhm,

the Ingredient Exposure hook. This

one about this hormone disrupting chemical,

the performance band hook,

Accidental Discovery,

Clinical Trial hook. So I want to make sure anything that is going to

be as congruent, so ignore Region Researcher.

So if I go look at this, is that part of the story?

Let's see. So

our foster is used by the Vikings. Okay,

cool. Right. Something's

interesting. I'll dissect these guys a lot more later, right?

Interesting, does not have a Norwegian researcher thing directed at it,

but you can still use it as an advertorial, uhm,

but because we know

this is already a winner anyway, or, you know, from an ad perspective,

I'd probably start with that, be like, look,

uhm, so let's go ahead and take this one,

right? Let's go ahead and do number blank.

Let's assume we want a medium-length advertorial,

okay? Put my head up here

a little bit. We'll do,

uhm, number five first.

Can you write an outline for a medium-length

advertorial with that angle? Now,

usually this would be more than enough.

And I almost don't want to show you, uhm,

on one hand I want to show you that this would be enough, but

like, uhm,

one thing to bring up is that this

type of story has worked really well in the brands

ads. I will see will copy and paste,

uh, the ad caption here,

so you can make the advertorial

agreement with this story.

Now let's go copy and paste that, right? Boop,

copy, boop,

paste, okay? Alright,

and we're having me an outline

first. I like, why do I like doing the outline?

I like doing the outline because I want to see That,

I wanna make sure that I like the structure, frankly. That's not doing something

really weird. It's not like It's almost always fine,

but like, just in case it's trying to, like, It zigs and zags instead

of being a well, you know, point by point avatorial.

So, that is why. Okay?

So, let's go ahead and do that. Let

Claude do its magic again. While

I'm shocked, team's face 90% clear in just one week after using this simple

trick. It's a pretty good avatorial headline,

right? Hook, 150-200 words.

Opening scene, the bathroom discovery.

Start with the mother hearing quiet crying. I don't want to talk about it

for months to see my son crying. Emotional tension.

Showering, mask the tears. Connect with other parents.

If you're a parent, you know that sound breaks your heart.

Agitation. The devastating impact.

Detail. The social isolation. No photos,

so parties avoiding mirrors. Most helplessness.

Watching your child suffer. The failed medical journey.

We tried it all. Dermatologist. Prescriptions. Expensive routines.

Some treatments making it worse. Financial costs.

An emotional toll. The feeling of desperation every parent can relate to.

Transition. I was running out of hope when I stumbled on something unexpected.

Dexameth found. I found Norse Organics by accident browsing online

late night. I don't know that we need to name the brand here.

I'm probably going to let it go for now, but I'll come back to

that potentially. Initial

skepticism. Internal debate.

researching the company, the Norwegian wild horse that it brought.

Approach vs. chemical treatment. She decided to try it despite skepticism,

the order of processing, and anxious awaiting.

The science behind it, brief. Why most acne treatments fail.

Treat symptoms not caused. How clogged pores and bacteria create the cycle.

Why arctic plants work differently than chemicals.

Clinical list showing 95% success rate.

I don't know if this was mentioned in- this is where you need to

still use your brain. I want to make sure they had,

uh, something about that on their landing page.

No side effects. The miraculous transformation.

Day 1 to day 2. Day 3,

day 7. This is very common in landing pages,

PDPs, and advertorials,

like, here's what happened right during this time structure.

So it gives them a timeline that they can envision the prospect of,

like, wow, I'm okay, this is what could happen for me, right? Um,

it feels realistic, but it's still fast. That's why it's kind of valuable.

The emotional moment of breakthrough. Return to normal teenage life.

Mother's relief and gratitude. Testimony from other parents.

Focus on speed of results. Emotional transformation.

Skeptic to believer stories. Urgency and scarcity.

Why this might not last. Growing demand.

Big beauty industry pushback. Limiting harvest window.

Recent media attention.

Increasing orders. Special pricing for readers won't last long.

Succeeding money back guarantee. Over 50,000 customers.

Clinical testing safety. Blah,

blah, blah. Call to action. Closing.

It might have been a little bit longer than I want,

but I think overall it sounds good.

Let me check on that 95% real quick here.

Is there 95% anywhere on this? Yeah,

there was. Okay, cool. So it's taking it from their claims on their page.

So now, I can,

I honestly, you don't even really need this part.

This used to be a really valuable prompt component for,

like, LLMs.

It still is for some LLMs, but again, Quad generally just kind of keeps

going. So I'm just gonna put some simply,

perfect, let's go ahead and write this advertorial now. It's

pretty, it is pretty cool.

I haven't talked about this much, but for months, I used to hear my

son cry quietly in the bathroom at night. He thought I couldn't hear him.

He waited until the shower was running so I wouldn't know, but I knew,

and every night it broke my heart. If you're a parent,

you know that sound, the muffled sobs of your child losing hope,

the quiet desperation they think they're hiding from you. It's the worst sound in

the world. My 16-year-old son, Jacob, had been battling severe acne for over two

years. What started as a few pimples had turned into something that was stealing

his childhood right before my eyes. It's a great copy.

So good. A heartbreak no parent should endure.

He wouldn't let me take photos of him anymore. Family gatherings became torture sessions

where he'd hide in his room. Birthday parties,

forget it. He stopped getting invited because he always said no.

The worst part was watching him avoid mirrors. This confident,

funny kid who used to make faces at himself getting ready for school,

now he'd brush his teeth looking down at the sink. His grades started slipping.

He quit the soccer team. His friends stopped coming around. As his mother,

I felt completely helpless. Every night, I'd lie awake wondering,

what was I doing wrong? Was it his diet,

his pillowcase, or were we not clean enough too much? When medicine fails you,

don't, you know, okay, subheader,

but. We tried everything the doctors recommended.

First, it was the drugstore cleansers. When those didn't work,

we graduated to the prescription topical creams and the oral antibiotics.

Each dermatologist visit cost us $200 and we were going monthly.

Some treatments made it worse. The benzenol approved.

Peroxide burned his skin so badly, he looked like he had a chemical burn.

The antibiotics gave him stomach problems and mood swings.

We did absolutely nothing except drain our bank account.

After 18 months and over $3,000 spent, we were exactly where we started,

except now Jake was more hopeless than ever and I was running out of

answers. Maybe this is just how I'll always look,

he told me one evening, and I had to excuse myself to cry in

the laundry room. The discovery that changed everything.

I found Norse Organics completely by accident. It was 2 a.m.

when I was doing what desperate mothers do, frantically googling severe teen acne natural

treatment for the hundredth time. I'd already bookmarked dozens of articles and forum posts,

but nothing had led anywhere. That's when I stumbled across a review that stopped

me cold. A mother from Texas was describing her 15-year-old daughter's transformation in just

two weeks. The photos were incredible, angry inflamed skin that had cleared to a

healthy glow. But here's what caught my attention. She said the same thing I

was thinking. I thought these reviews were fake.

They had to be. Results as fast as seemed impossible.

I spent the next three hours reading everything I could find.

Story after story of teenagers getting their confidence back,

parents crying tears of joy instead of heartbreak.

But I was skeptical. After so many disappointments, how could some balms from Norway

be the answer when prescription medicine had failed?

Why most acne treatments actually make things worse? What I learned next shocked me.

Most acne treatments, including the ones we've spent thousands on,

actually only attack the surface symptoms. They dry out your skin,

kill both good and bad bacteria, and create a cycle where your skin overproduces

oil to compensate. It's like putting a band-aid on a broken pipe.

You might hide the problem temporarily, but you're not fixing anything.

The real issue is deeper. When your pores get clogged with excess oil and

dead skin cells, it creates the perfect environment for acne bacteria to multiply.

Most treatments either skip your skin so harshly that it rebounds worse than before,

or they're too gentle to actually clear the blockages.

But Norse organics works differently. Their products are made from wild harvested plants that

survive in the harsh arctic conditions of Norway. These plants have developed incredibly powerful

natural compounds to protect themselves, compounds that can break through clogged pores and eliminate

acne bacteria without destroying your skin's natural balance.

In clinical studies, 95% of users saw their acne clear within 60 days.

But what really convinced me were the stories and results of Norse in just

the first week. No harsh chemicals, no prescription side effects,

just pure natural healing that works with your skin instead of against it.

The moment that changed everything. I was desperate,

so I ordered the complete acne killer system. When it arrived two days later,

I'll admit I was nervous. Jake had been disappointed so many times before.

What if this was just another false hope?

By the way, if you're thinking this is pretty long, it is, but the

copy is very good. But also,

after we finished going through this, this one, I'm going to say,

hey, let's do a 50%,

a version that's 50% as long,

or like half the length, basically, right? So let's keep going through this one

first. The routine was surprisingly simple.

Just three steps twice a day, a gentle cleanser,

the acne fighting balm, and a light moisturizer, all made from those powerful arctic

plants. Jake was skeptical too, but he agreed to try it.

What's the worst that could happen, mom? It doesn't work. It doesn't work like

everything else. Day one, we started the routine.

Jake's skin looked the same, which I expected. Day two,

still the same. I started to worry we'd been fooled again.

Day three, I was making breakfast when Jake came downstairs.

Something was different. The angry redness that had been constant for months,

it was calmer, noticeably calmer. Mom used it quietly.

My face doesn't hurt when I touch it. Day seven,

the swelling had faded. It was painful, deep cysts that had been dominating his

jawline were flattening out. His skin looked smoother than it had in two years,

but the real moment, the one that still makes me cry thinking about it,

happened on day 10. I walked past the bathroom and saw Jake smiling at

himself in the mirror. He smiled. After two years of avoiding his own reflection,

my son was looking at himself and smiling. The transformation continues.

Three weeks later, Jake's skin was 90% clearer.

The few remaining spots were tiny and fading fast, but the real transformation was

his spirit. He joined a new club at school,

started hanging out with friends again, even asked a girl at a homecoming,

something I never thought I'd do. Last week, he asked if we could take

a new family photo for Christmas cards. I don't care what the science says

or what other brands promise, this is what worked for No side effects,

no chemicals that burned his skin, just gentle,

natural healing that gave me my son back. Why this solution almost didn't exist.

Here's the thing that really opened my eyes, Norse Organics almost didn't make it

to market. These arctic plants can only be harvested during specific seasons and only

in small quantities to protect the environment. The traditional skin care industry doesn't want

solutions like this, but because they can't mass-produce them in factories or add cheap

filler ingredients. Big beauty companies have spent millions convincing us that we need harsh

chemicals and complicated routines. They profit when treatments sort of

work, but don't actually cure the problem, because that keeps you blind forever.

But Norse Organics is different. It's a family-owned company that wild-harvests their ingredients from

the same Norwegian mounds that their ancestors did.

They're not trying to compete with commercial skin care, they're trying to preserve ancient

knowledge that actually works. The problem is, they can't only make limited quantities each

year, and with more parents discovering how well this works,

they're constantly selling out. What other parents are saying,

I'm not the only mother who experienced this miracle. This says written testimonials.

Frankly, I'd probably just do visual pictures and something like this,

like, because I kind of like what they have on their website,

because I wouldn't want the copy to go so long.

But, you know, they're good little testimonials.

My daughter's cystic acne was so severe,

She's becoming depressed, three weeks of Norse organics,

and she's a different kid, the compass is back,

social anxiety is gone, I can't thank them enough. Right?

So, it writes good placeholder testimonials,

but like, you know, to be compliant, you would obviously want to put real

testimonials, pictures of people,

testimonials, whatever it is. When you need to act now.

I'm sharing this story because I know there are other parents out there hearing

their children crying in bathrooms, watching their kids lose confidence,

feeling helpless about it. Like I did. But here's what you need to know,

Norse organics is facing the same supply chain challenges that almost kept me from

finding this solution. They can only harvest, again,

it's a little repetitive here, they can only harvest these arctic plants during specific

seasons, the wild nature of these ingredients means they can't just order more from

a factory when they run low, and with word spreading about how well this

works, they've been selling out faster than ever. Just last month,

they had a two week waiting list because demand exceeded their supply.

Plus the major skin care companies can't start taking notice. When a small Norwegian

company starts threatening their billion dollar industry with actual results,

you can bet they're not happy about it. Risk free for desperate parents.

Here's what convinced me to try Norse organics when I was skeptical about everything.

They offer a complete 60 day money back guarantee, not 30 days like most

companies full 60 days, use the entire system if your child doesn't see dramatic

improvements in their skin and their confidence, send it back for a complete refund,

no questions asked. They can make this guarantee because they because they want to

help as many families as possible,

they're offering a special discount for readers of this article.

Instead of paying the full retail price,

parents can save

up

to 40% on the complete acne killer system,

but only through this special link, and only while supplies last.

This isn't available in stores, and it's not the price you'll find on the

regular website. It's specifically for parents who've read the story and recognize your own

family's struggle. This system includes everything you need,

the gentle cleanser, the powerful acne fighting balm,

and the healing moisturizer, all made from those same wild arctic plants that transform

Jake's skin. Don't let your child suffer another day.

If you're a mother or father watching your child struggle like I watched Jake's

struggle, please don't wait. Don't let them spend another night crying in the bathroom,

thinking you can't hear them. Don't watch them miss another birthday party,

avoid another photo, or lose more confidence while you wait for the perfect solution.

This is what worked for us. This is what worked for thousands of other

families, and it could work for yours, too. Your child deserves to smile at

their reflection again. They deserve to feel confident in their own skin.

They deserve to be a teenager without the burden of severe acne stealing their

joy. Norse Organics gave me my son back.

Let them give you your child back, too. The worst that can happen is

that it doesn't work, and you get your money back. But the best that

can happen, the best that can happen is everything. Again,

maybe, well, we're gonna do copy-shipping in other modules.

You know, little things that might change, like,

this, it's okay. Just a little bit overdramatic.

Click here to claim your family's 40% discount,

limited time, 60 day money-back guarantee,

free shipping, secure checkout. Okay? So, overall,

I don't know what you think. I think it's pretty great. I think it's

really good overall. Um, you can tell Claude that,

right? So, was,

uh, I'm gonna say this is,

sorry, this is great, really nice job.

Um, can you now do another version of

this habitorial that retains the

main structure and elements.

But that's 50% shorter,

let me say about 50% shorter, uh, so I can have a less lengthy

version to also test.

Okay,

so that's

good because it's long, it's good, but like, we'd like to test it. We

want to compare, right, and it might be, at first I think that could

work, but I still think,

uhm,

you know, sometimes, perhaps, for sure, one's going to be better,

we just want to build test options, right? Superfacetous,

right? So, same headline.

It's got the same copy elements, it's just much punchier,

right? I don't talk about this much,

but for months I used to hear my son cry quietly in the bathroom

at night. He thought I couldn't hear him, he'd wait until the shower was

running so I wouldn't know, but I knew and every night it broke my

heart. My 16-year-old Jake wouldn't let me take photos of him,

wouldn't go to birthday parties, wouldn't even look in the mirror. He's like,

his severe acne had stolen his confidence completely, when everything else failed.

We tried it all, dermatologists, prescriptions, expensive routines,

some things made it worse, others did nothing at all except drain our bank

account. After 18 months and over $3,000 spent,

we were exactly where we started, except now Jake was more hopeless than ever.

Maybe this is just how I'll always look, he told me one evening.

That's when I knew I had to find another way. The accidental discovery.

I found Norris Organics by accident while desperately googling it.

I read their reviews and thought they were fake,

they had to be, results this fast seemed impossible after so many failures,

but I was desperate so I ordered. Here's what I learned.

Most acne treatments only attack surface symptoms,

they strip your skin so harshly that rebounds worsen before creating an endless cycle.

Norris Organics was different. Their wild harvested arctic plants break through clogged pores and

eliminate acne bacteria without destroying your skin's natural balance.

In clinical studies, 95% of users saw their acne clear within 60 days.

The transformation, the routine was simple, 3 steps twice a day. Got,

you know, uhm, day 3,

day 7, day 10, right, so we have these things, whoopsie, ah,

f***, I don't know why I was depressed. Uhm,

smiled at himself, he smiled,

after 2 years, smiling,

kept this emotional part, which I like. 3 weeks later,

his skin was 90% clear, but the real transformation was his spirit.

He joined new clubs, started hanging out with friends again, even asked to go

out on a home coming, why it didn't exist, same idea here,

right, what their parents were saying, could probably still do some sketchy testimonials,

could still do screenshots, risk-free solution,

still got the kind of guarantee, 50,000 families,

all that kind of stuff, special opportunity,

you can get 40% off, only available while supplies last,

don't wait, don't let your kid cry,

uhm. That's

pretty much everything they could do for us, here's a discount, so perfect,

right, which is really cool, and that's something to keep in mind too,

right, I've been saying this for years now, but, with AI,

it's like, you know, you're still the boss,

for now, so, when you see something long,

you're like, well, it's good, but it's too long, it's kinda cool, then tell

it to do a shorter version, you know what I'm saying? Okay,

sweet, number two. Remember, this was just one angle,

right, it gave us these,

uh, different ones here, so like,

for example,

let's do the art discovery, just so

you see one more example real quick, Great job.

Now, let's, do hook number 6,

the Arctic Discovery,

uhm, for this, let's make, let's keep it shorter,

make

the short version

of the advertorial you just did, uhm, let's still have the target audience be

parents of kids, I'm gonna say frustrated parents,

frustrated parents of kids with,

uh, acne, uhm,

but incorporate this discovery,

uhm, actually

I'm just gonna keep of kids about me.

All right. So,

let's see how this one comes out, and then I'll show,

you know, examples from, uh, probably like a biz-op niche,

since this was like a sort of like a consumable topical,

and, uh,

you know, it'll be good, maybe I'll include more examples.

Actually, I might show you one other thing beyond that.

Okay, scientists discover these rare arctic plants destroy acne bacteria three times faster than

prescriptions. New research from Norway reveals why Big Pharma doesn't want you to know

about this natural breakthrough. I might do, like I said,

Big Pharma, like, you know,

big skincare companies, because, you know, you better. Dr. Erika Johansson was studying plant

survival in the Norwegian Arctic when she made a discovery that would change acne

treatment forever. While researching how certain plants survive temperatures of minus 40 degrees in

months without sunlight, he noticed something remarkable.

These plants Thank produced incredibly powerful antimicrobial compounds,

far stronger than anything he'd seen in traditional medicine,

well, we found and defied everything we thought we knew about natural skincare.

Dr. Johansson told our research team these other plants weren't just surviving,

they were thriving conditions that would kill any other organism.

The breakthrough that shocked researchers. When Dr.

Johansson's team tested these plants, plant extracts against acne bacteria in the lab,

the results were so dramatic they had to repeat the experiment multiple times.

The artic plant compounds eliminated acne bacteria three times faster than benzyl

peroxide, the gold standard prescription acne treatment.

But unlike harsh chemicals, these natural compounds did without damaging healthy skins.

We can believe the data, said Dr.

Johansson, these plants were outperforming pharmaceutical drugs that took decades and millions of dollars

to develop. The secret? These arctic plants have spent thousands of years developing the

most powerful natural defense systems on earth. They had to,

it was adapt or die. And one of the plant,

a plant's harshest environments, why your teen's acne keeps coming back.

Here's what most parents don't know. Prescription acne treatments work by essentially carpet bombing

your teen's skin with chemicals. Yes, they kill acne bacteria,

but they also destroy the good bacteria that keeps skin healthy.

This creates a cycle where your teen's skin becomes dependent on the other treat,

on the treatment and acne returns worse than ever when they stop.

It's like burning down a forest to kill the weeds.

You might solve the immediate problem, but you're just, you've destroyed the entire ecosystem.

These arctic plants work differently.

They've selectively, they selectively target only the harmful bacteria while actually strengthening your skin's

natural defenses. That's why teens see lasting results instead of the endless cycle of

dependency. Real results from desperate parents.

When word got out about Dr. Johanson's discovery,

desperate parents started seeking out these arctic plant extracts.

Some testimonials again. The supply problem.

Here's the challenge. These specific arctic plants can only be harvested during a narrow

period window each year and only in certain regions of northern Norway.

The farm industry has taken notice of Dr. Johanson's research,

but they can't replicate these compounds in a lab. Nature's complexity can't be mass-produced

in a factory. That's why only one company, Norse Organics,

has secured the rights to harvest these plants sustainably.

They work directly with Dr. Johanson's research team and local Norwegian harvesters who've been

gathering these plants for generations. Big pharma's worse than I'm here.

A treatment that actually works long-term is a pharmaceutical industry's biggest fear.

They profit from treatments that kind of work but keep customers dependent forever.

Dr. Johanson's Arctic discovery threatens billions in revenue from prescription acne treatments.

These natural compounds don't just clear acne, they break the cycle of dependency that

keeps teens struggling for years. We've received pressure to limit our research.

Dr. Johanson admits certain companies would prefer these findings stay buried.

Clinical proof. The research speaks for itself. 95% of users saw

significant improvement. Data here, right?

Compare that to prescription treatments for 40% of users relapse within 60 months and

side effects include depression, birth defects, and liver damage.

Limited access for families. Um,

they made it available to families. Here's the cash,

they're going to produce limited quantities. Right now they're offering,

uh, they're completing our system for 45% off the regular price.

Um, Each system contains enough for a full 60-day treatment.

I don't know if that's true, I would double-check that. Risk-free for skeptical parents.

Don't let the pharmaceutical companies win. Blah, blah, blah. I think here they're talking

about a 90-day guarantee. I think previously I thought we said there was a

60-day. Let's go look at the guarantee.

There's

a 60-day guarantee. Yeah,

okay. So, again, this is where you have to pay attention to detail,

right? So for this one,

great job, a few things.

Instead of speaking English. Specifically about Big Pharma,

let's talk about big skin care companies.

Instead,

we can still also reference prescriptions,

treatments, but I don't want the whole thing being focused

on anti-Big Pharma.

Next,

let's make this 25%. About.

Why do I say about? Because I don't want to, like, it has to

be 25% and it could be better if it was 24% or 26%.

I'm going to say about, let's say about 20% shorter.

Third, it's a 60-day guarantee.

Okay,

here's

another

thing, going back to attention to detail. Uh,

I want a little more congruency between

discovering these plants and the decision

to test them for, uh,

against acne bacteria, right?

All right, so basically. So

we have this section here. I

think what's missing is something like Dr.

Johansson.

When Dr. Johansson saw the, uh,

the incredible antimicrobial power

of these plants, he immediately thought about acne.

Let's go ahead and perhaps even say that's because

his own teenage sons both suffered from severe

acne and nothing they'd tried to Right?

So, I mean, how do I do that if I'm trying to teach copywriting?

And it's sort of like common sense.

Like, I'm gonna have another module on sort of the best habits of really

good copywriters and one with sort of attention to detail.

And it's also like third,

like, entering a dissociative state, meaning you're sort of disconnecting, like, from the copyright

However, if you were, like, a third party reading it,

would you ask, would you be like, hmm,

like, well, why would he, like, what objection would you have?

Right? Like, why would he find these plants and immediately go test it on

acne bacteria? It's like, well, here's the answer. Okay?

Now, obviously, this one's sort of like a made-up story.

You can figure out ways when you're doing these to ensure anything that you

have is congruent, uh,

truthful, whatever it may be. Or, you know,

sabatorial, so you can kind of, not, but you'd have to say,

you know, hey, this is like a sort of made-up story or composite story,

whatever you want to do, right? Um,

but for now, I'm supposed to show you, you know, how this stuff works,

right? So there's that feedback, okay? So let's see,

um,

uh,

yeah, let's keep it

there. I think it was a little bit longer. Again,

it's not bad that it's long, I just think it would be better if

it was, like, maybe it was a little bit longer than it needed to

be. And by the way, you'll still have this old version when you scroll

up that was longer, but now it's going to be the short version,

so it's going to edit for us, right? Okay,

Dr.

Eric Johansson was studying plant survival and then, oh,

okay, we'll let it finish editing.

So,

headline,

Dr.

Eric

Johansson was studying plant survival in the Norwegian Arctic when he made a discovery

that would change the acne treatment forever. While researching how the certain plants survive

temperatures of negative 40 degrees Fahrenheit and months without sunlight,

he noticed something remarkable. These plants produce incredible,

incredibly powerful antimicrobial compounds far stronger than anything he'd seen in traditional

medicine. Here's what made, uh,

you know, I think we can make this a better transition,

but for now, but here's what made Dr. Johansson immediately think about acne.

Both of his teenage sons were suffering from severe breakouts and nothing they tried

was working. Sponsored dermatologist visits,

prescription treatments, every practice, the skincare industry promised would help,

all failures. When I saw these antimicrobial compounds,

I thought about my boys struggling with their confidence every day. Dr.

Johansson told our research team, well, if nature had already solved this problem thousands

of years ago. Um,

what I would do as an edit here, I would just go ahead and

share. I

would probably take this quote and put it up here.

Um,

and then I would take this part, put it underneath the quote,

and be like, you know,

I had to be like, I thought about my boys struggling, you know, about

my teenage sons who both struggled with severe acne,

um.

And how these issues were ruining their confidence,

you know, had really completely destroyed their confidence, he told our team.

What if Nutri had solved this problem thousands of years ago?

Then I'd be like, you know, this problem fell on Dr.

Johansson, because despite spending thousands

of dollars on both prescription over-the-counter treatments,

uh,

his son's severe breakouts continued,

uh, kept getting worse and worse.

Um,

and you can still have this line, right? So, that's how I would edit

this part. I would You know,

I'll include an edited version here. Maybe with the breakthrough,

why our team's not gonna keep coming back,

we're always lost from desperate parents, it's probably gonna be pushed back.

So, I made the rest of it just shorter and punchier, right? So,

again, we'll talk in other trainings about why I select different lengths,

but that's how I do this. So, let's go ahead and I'll show you

how I would edit this. So, I just said it. So.

I don't, I mean, I would add the headline too, I'm not gonna do

that one in this call, or in this call, in this training.

I'm just

gonna do 150 for you.

Uh,

my. Boys,

uh.

Tsk, Thousands

of dollars on

and

solutions

yet. Breakouts kept getting

worse. Okay, so that's how I would edit this part.

It's one of the only parts that really needs to be edited, but to

me, now it feels congruent and it just reads better.

And again, we'll do other modules on full copy JPEG,

okay, but that's how I would edit this so you can just see it

in real time. Alright,

I am going to be pausing, and I'll

come back and show a couple other examples in a video, and I'll show

you, uhm, oh yeah, do that next, alright.
