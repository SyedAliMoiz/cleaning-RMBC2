Alright, so now we're going to be talking about product

pages, which are kind of the same thing as what we

would have called an e-com landing page a while back.

I mean, it's sort of the same thing in a way.

It's interchangeable. And

we're going to look at a bunch of examples. What I want to kind

of talk about is, let me just show you

an example, okay? This is a

product page for the brand Happy Mammoth.

This is a product

page for the brand Happy Mammoth.

Both of these things are running right

now. Sorry,

I'm trying to gather my thoughts.

Both these things, there's ads running right now,

so I'm going show you this video. Some of the ads go to this

page, some of the ads go to this page.

Like, okay, why?

A lot of reasons, but let's go back to the purpose,

right? What are the purposes of product pages? Sometimes,

it's to do heavy selling,

okay? Like,

back in the day, there used to be text sales letters,

which are kind of the same thing as what you're seeing here,

but most people have moved to this really kind of sexy

hybrid approach, where it's like a product

page, it's very long, but it's more branded on the nose,

it's easier to run on Facebook, other traffic sources,

it's more of a branded experience, people accept it these days,

so you can get high conversions while being branded,

while still potentially selling your company for lots of money.

Right? All that kind of stuff.

Uh,

another great example is Emma, I mean, I can hopefully just have it say

it, let's see, Emma, Is it this one?

Yeah, like, we have this example later, right? This is a product page,

great design,

you know, arguably not that much copy,

but kind of not, fairly long, right? Then you've got,

I'm gonna do like A or B, because I'm trying to think of how

to, like, it, it's not, I guess

you said it, I guess, you know, you're doing heavy selling,

you're also presenting a more branded experience while pushing,

I guess that's true.

The thing is, they're not mutually exclusive. So as you saw,

if you watch the advertorial example, sometimes product pages are not doing a lot

of heavy selling, right?

Sometimes,

okay. But

I don't really have to say the opposite of this, because it's not that,

to not do heavy selling, but sometimes,

you know, it's to present a brand experience

while pushing prospects over the hump. Sometimes,

it's both, right?

So if you look at, that Emma example,

this example from Happy Mammoth, it's both.

It's like, yes, it's sort of branded,

it's nice, but it's doing a lot of heavy selling as well. If we

look at this page,

realistically, like, yeah, they still want to convert,

but this is ideally going to somebody who is already kind

of pre-sold. And as you'll recall,

while I don't know that Happy Mammoth does this that often,

often what you find is people who go to pages like this come

by way of an advertorial,

right? In fact,

what I should do here to make my life easier is

pull up my

1D of advertorial thing from earlier, all the links I shared. So, like, for

example, just give me one moment,

Like, you know, so, as you'll recall, we had,

like, the long advertorial from these people,

Clarifyon, doing a ton of selling,

after it checks my availability, product page is super basic and simple,

right? Uhm,

so, it's kind of weird how they do this,

but it's working for them, I suppose.

Very simple, basic and basic product page, okay?

Uhm,

so, again, yeah, when is a product page typically longer?

Usually when there's static ads,

or a short video ad, and typically,

a kind of shorter advertorial,

right? Typically, you have a short advertorial,

longer product page, right? So, basically, it's really simple,

actually, when you think about this. You have to do the selling somewhere.

With very few exceptions. Like GLP-1 medications,

you're able to get away with not very much selling,

because it is a historically in-demand product

that everybody knows works, and that everybody wants. When people try and hijack

trends, that's kind of what they're going for. And if you do hijack a

trend, you can kind of get away with that. Although,

if it's not a medication, you can sometimes run into differentiation,

right? But, generally,

the one advantage of trend hijacking is you don't necessarily need a ton of

copy. Because, if everybody is like,

the zeitgeist is that everybody knows this works, they all want it,

whatever it is. Then, it's like, really,

just, hey, we've got it, we're trustworthy, you're gonna get it

fast, we've got great reviews, buy it from us. But those are extremely rare,

right? Those are very, very rare circumstances.

Most of the time, whatever it is you're selling,

you have to do education and selling somewhere,

Thanks. So, you have to educate them on why other,

depending on their awareness level, you have to educate them on why other solutions

haven't worked, the real cause of their problem,

at the very least, if people are product aware,

like, pretty highly solution aware, you need to educate them on why other

products don't work, why yours is the superior,

and, you know, part of drug response copy is twisting the knife or finding

a bleeding neck problem and sort of, like,

ratcheting up the intensity of that problem so that they're like,

you know what, I need to take action now and not later,

right? We're trying to get them to directly respond and take action today,

not take action tomorrow or next week or next month or next year.

So, you have to do that somewhere. So, if you have a short little

ad, static ad, short little video ad,

short little advertorial, you know,

you might be a little bit pre-sold, but you need to do more selling,

hence the longer lander. Now,

if you have, like, uh,

medium or longer video ads, you know,

especially, this is like the more, the longer skits,

the shorter your PDP could be, typically.

Uhm,

and a longer advertorial, then you've done the work there,

so you don't necessarily need to do it again on the PDP.

But, there are exceptions. One of the most interesting ones,

so I'm going to pause. I mean, hopefully that makes sense. I think it

should. You can always re-watch what I just said. It's very important.

It's a really important our marketing concepts, so I really hope people are paying

attention, right? The one really interesting exception

to this, not the one, but one of the notable ones would actually be

Nuro, who we've talked about before, right? They'll run these ads,

like, this is a 15 minute long video ad.

When you click shop now, it goes to this

quote-unquote advertorial that is,

You know, about the product, but really educational and long,

Pre-sum a lot, and when you click to the next page,

it's their product page, which is actually also quite

long. Now, they've done really well with this format,

something to test, but this is pretty rare.

Very few people, a few people I know are doing something similar and doing

quite well with it, so, you know,

worth testing, but this,

as of when I'm making RMBC2,

July 1st, and the course comes out in 6 days,

so she needs some of these modules that are missing, uhm,

this is pretty rare. So generally what I just said is

the way that it works, okay? So,

this is important because how I write a product page, it depends on what

the goal is. It depends on where their, what the rest of the journey

before the product page looks like, you know? That's where this is also contextual,

and why it's important. So let's go back to our friends at Happy Mammoth,

okay? If we go up here,

this ad, Your body naturally changes with time,

and yes, that can bring new challenges, but with the right support,

it doesn't have to feel like an uphill battle. Ultimate weight loss support is

designed to improve your body, especially,

uhm, through hormonal shifts, helping you stay balanced,

energizing, and in control. Now, I'm pretty sure that, uh, Seth's visit Instagram,

right? So some of these ads like, here's a Fiverr one,

so I'm not, I'm pretty sure this actually is gonna go to that short

little e-com page,

so you're gonna say, well, what the hell, Seth, and, I'll be honest with

you.

I don't think this ad converts very well,

I mean, except for, for retargeting,

right? My assumption is if ads like this, That's it.

These are probably more for, like, retargeting than they are for cold traffic,

right? These are, I could be wrong, but I would guess,

and be pretty confident in saying, most likely,

either they're a pretty well-known brand already, these are probably more often than not

going to people, I'm just

curious,

okay,

are they including,

globally,

like, this is either retargeting,

or, ...or it is, ,kind of

broad, build-up brand awareness type of stuff,

okay? It's going to that lander.

Typically, whether they're doing it or not, typically when somebody comes to a page

like this, ...one...

...because there's something long in front of it.

Let's just look at the structure of this page,

okay? Get your old self back naturally.

Our premium, evidence-based formulas are transforming the lives of over 2.4 million women worldwide.

Regain control of your health, emotions, well-being starting now.

Shop products. It has their hormone harmony.

Shop our best sellers. Has different products here.

View all the products. Some social proof. I guess,

arguably, this is not even a product page. It's like,

...their store homepage. So maybe that's,

hence, why not an example. But this is where I go back to. This

is probably for branding, brand building. You see some big companies doing this.

They're probably trying the same approach. I'm not gonna lie,

I don't think it works for cold traffic. I bet they're not making money

on this, but, like, they want to sell it to private equity or some

shit. Be honest with you. But most of their ads,

besides these recent ones, will tend to tell you a different story,

right? At 52,

I got my figure back. It's been 12 years since I felt this good

in my body. Since menopause, my body felt different in ways I didn't expect,

and nothing seemed to help. Then I found Hormone Harmony from Happy Mammoth,

and while I did not expect this transformation, I feel calm and clear.

They have other ads that are similar to take us to this page,

okay? So you'll notice they sort of have a template that works,

okay? And this is essentially,

like I said, a kind of like a mini sales letter.

1.3 million women beat hormonal weight gain thanks to Hormone Harmony.

I'll find out how women across the globe started losing

weight, reduced top flashes, and beat mood swings without intense exercise or eating like

rabbits. Sudden weight gain is the number one most frustrating symptom for

women. Why don't diets and exercise work after 40?

During menopause, hormonal fat production increases.

So what are we going to do now? We're going to do sort of

like the unique mechanism of the problem.

Hormonal fat production starts as early as age 30.

That's why so many women notice weight gain in perimenopause even if they've been

naturally thin for years. Worse, no amount of diet or exercise helps.

Why? Hormonal fat is totally different from normal fat.

Unlike normal fat, hormonal weight gain is caused by sudden changes in hormone levels,

such as sharp decline in estradiol, which regulates metabolism and body weight,

rapid spikes of cortisol that block weight loss,

or thyroid imbalances that slow down metabolism and force us to accumulate fat.

That's why traditional weight loss methods simply do not work for women dealing with

hormonal weight gain. Finally, there's good news for women of all ages.

Now it's possible to maintain a healthy weight gain,

or weight, and get a flat belly at any age with Hormone Harmony.

Hormone Harmony uses 12 science-backed extracts to help target and burn hormonal belly fat,

the number one goal cause of hormonal weight gain, energy slumps,

sore joints, and even mood swings. Each ingredient is proven to balance key hormones

that fluctuate during premenopause, menopause,

and postmenopause so the body burns fat on autopilot.

86% of users experience weight loss.

So if we think about what we're actually looking at here, so here's your

UMP, this is the real cause of your problem,

this hormonal weight gain. What's your UMS?

Well, it's used as product And it's a logical connection,

right? It balances hormones that would fluctuate so your body burns fat on autopilot.

All it takes is three capsules a day to melt hormonal fat and feel

like you again. Okay, 12 natural extracts,

adaptogens, and nutrients hand-selected by leading nutrition and hormonal weight loss experts.

Each ingredient is backed by decades of research, thousands of studies,

and has been perfectly measured in the exact scientific dose to help melt stubborn

fat and beat hormonal symptoms without the need for intense diet or exercise.

Each ingredient, what it does.

Dimensionalizing ain't really selling,

yet. Now, let's do something fun.

I'm gonna make this prompt. I'm going to share

two landing page,

or I should say two product page links from a brand

with you for two different products.

similar. Please review them and

then I would like for you to create a

templatized outline that

captures both the structure and all of the common

elements. This should be something someone

could use for other products

and brands to produce similar

product pages, uhm,

period. Let's try that, right? And then let's take these two links,

okay? So we have this one.

And then we

have SlimControl.

Honestly,

I can probably just do like this,

I'm assuming. Let me just double check the tag so it's less messy.

Okay, cool. Now,

let's go back to our friends at Claude.

Make sure the web search is enabled.

And honestly,

this wasn't my, I have another

process for this that I was planning on sharing, but for fun. Now that

Claude, you know, scours the internet and stuff.

We'll

you know, that, it didn't do for both of them,

it did for one, not the other Let's cut the content.

Pattern, clinical study I

mean, we're gonna get really weird Let's do two things,

let's copy this So say,

pdp, uh,

outline creation prompt for Quad,

okay. But now,

we'll save that, like, happy mammoth,

uh,

pdp outline sample, uh, sorry happy mammoth but don't worry we can do it

for everybody Here's what is gonna

be interesting, here's why I said we're gonna get weird, right? So,

I'll show you two things with this, I know I'm going on a bit

of a tangent an adventure,

but this is the speed I feel like you kinda need to work with

with AI right now, okay? Before I get to this,

well, I'll do it and then I'll come back actually, I don't wanna, okay.

Awesome. So now,

if we were going to create a new pdp for

the eye serum, uh,

following this structure what would it look like?

Can you go ahead and create and

write the copy for it and indicate other design and structural elements?

Here's the current pdp. I'm gonna

say I said create, we're gonna test new so now I have my UDI

serum, right? Okay, so why I threw away $2,000 worth of eye creams

and finally got

my 25 year old eyes back at 52.

The world's first and only eye serum that targets the hidden skin cells.

Separation causing 87% of eye aging. Prevent reverse wrinkles,

dark circles, and eye bags as low as 14 days.

Got your things here. Get your trust indicators.

Usage instructions,

simply apply a small amount around each eye morning and night.

Watch your eyes mode away. As women hit their 30s,

their eyes age 3x faster than the rest of their face.

It's true. Groundbreaking study by dermatological researchers has shown found that the delicate eye

area loses collagen and elasticity at triple the rate of other facial skin.

So you suddenly noticed deep crow's feet,

dark circles, puffy eye bags, droopy eyelids.

You need to stop wasting money on surface level eye creams right now.

Because you don't need more moisture, you need to stop your skin layers from

separating. The real problem. See,

every anti-aging cream on the market makes the same fatal mistake.

They only work on the surface of your skin. The real damage is happening

much deeper in the dermal-epidermal junction. When you're young,

these layers are tightly bonded together by tiny hooks,

but here's the devastating truth. Starting at 30,

these vital connections begin breaking down. The result,

your skin layers literally start separating from each other.

This is why no amount of expensive eye creams work, because you're treating the

symptoms, not the cause. Scientific breakthrough.

It's now possible to re-bond separated skin layers and reverse years of eye aging

with UDI serum. Research back to ingredients it's seen in.

For 8 years of research, we finally cracked the code.

We created the world's first eye serum that penetrates deep into the dermal-epidermal junction

to rebuild those crucial connections between your skin layers.

The results, visible age reversal, starts working in just 14 days.

Testimonials. The 6 biggest anti-aging breakthroughs

in the past decade locked in a single serum. Okay,

it kind of likes that thing here.

There's this Harvard researcher's discovery of youth peptide.

Swiss scientists reveal a moisture agent that holds 100x its weight.

German botanists uncover a skin-lifting leaf that tightens loose eye skin.

Japanese study exposes a dark circle disorder that brightens under-eyes.

French scientists create an instant tightening compound from natural sources.

American dermatologists identify collagen building blocks that rebuild the aging skin.

Right? I mean,

it's pretty wild, right? I'm gonna copy this as well.

Go, like, put this somewhere.

Let's go. Unity,

Eye Serum. I might

do this. Sorry, I pushed it up here. Eye Serum.

PDP example.

Happy Panda Swipe. Okay,

so.

Remember

the brief we did? And I guess here's where I want to pause.

I know I'm going from, hey, overviewing of a PDP to,

like, just creating PDPs, but to me, again, this is, like, where I think

you kind of have to move fast these days. And when

you see PDPs that you like or that you know are working,

like, you can just go swipe them. I know Happy Mammoth's gonna be super

annoying, but not everyone should swipe Happy Mammoth. There's tons of stuff.

Like, we can do tons of examples in here. Uhm,

you can test different types, right? Like,

let's do it again, right? So here's Emma Relief.

Emma Relief has a somewhat similar structure to Happy Mammoth.

Surprising root cause. How it works.

So they do have a video, which is worthwhile. How long is their video?

5 minutes? Okay.

Odd colon, the hidden cause of this stuff.

Social proof, powerhouse ingredients.

This was the Happy Mammoth example. Let me do it like this,

sorry. Like, Let's

say, I'm going to get a template for Emma this time,

okay? All I would do,

is go like, I'm going to share,

A product page link.

Command view,

uhm, Please

review it, and then I would like you to create a templates outline that

captures the structure and all the common elements.

Uhm, this should be something that someone could use for other products or brands

to produce similar product pages,

right? So here we'll do the example.

I'll do this one in a second, so that we're clear here.

Chat. I'm early.

Bing bong While

it's doing this. Make sure I get the right UTI

serum. Brief, uh.

Because I think I had, uh. Yeah,

I made sure I added the aminos and stuff like that. So let me

see, like. I

know by the time we got to, like. I'll show you what I'm doing

in a second. So I know you're probably like, what. He's mumbling to himself.

Yeah, there we go. Company

logo, navigation, trust indicator. Primary headline,

sub-headline. Hero product shot.

Okay.

So, like,

hemorrhoid relief,

PDP, outline, template.

It's pretty wild, right?

This is like, it's so crazy. I don't know how people aren't,

hopefully everyone's doing this. I don't know, man. But if you're not,

I'm not sure what you're doing with your life. Uhm,

okay. So now, okay, great. Now let's use this same structure,

outline, to create a new PDP

we can test for. Test for,

uhm,

iserum.nbrand. Here is a brief with,

which should include all the information you need.

Okay, because remember previously, we took it from,

uh,

the website. This time,

we're going to take it from that new UDI serum, uh, brief, right? Just

trying to remember where I

put the, uh, put that brief here,

so give me a second. Okay,

so this is the same brief, it says medium length, but this is the

same brief we did in the VSL section. Okay.

Let's see what it comes up with here.

Alright, cool, I'm going to do it. Ooh,

it's actually coding it.

You write the copy and mention,

uh,

okay, where various design elements should go.

And look at actually coding it,

like, how it's doing like this.

Alright,

so this is good, but it's being annoying.

Like, clearly what we're doing is good,

but it's being walkie. So what do I need to do here?

This template,

What I should have done is saved my other prompt. See,

I purposely used that language too. There's

that. Okay,

I'm gonna, Do a product page,

blah blah.

It's annoying. I'm gonna run this prompt.

I'm actually gonna do this. Okay, we have our template now.

I'm gonna download this.

Okay,

say, Here's a template outline

for a product page I created.

Actually, you created it. Screw it. You created,

uh,

based off this PDP by Emma,

a brand called Emma.

Okay, let's, Pop

this in here. Upload

the outline. Uhm,

now I'd like your help to write.

This is going to come back to my language I had.

to be the exact perfect language, but I'll see what I Okay,

uhm,

uh, I'm going to test the new PDF for following structure.

What will it look like? Can you go ahead and write the copy for

it and indicate all of the design structural elements? Uhm,

I've attached a brief to give you

all of the information, the high serum you need.

Okay. And now let's put that brief back in.

There we go. And let's start.

Oh my god,

I don't know why it's coding

right now.

This is so annoying. Ugh.

All

right. Well, I'm not sure why it's coding.

I could probably just do 3.7 and have it not code.

But now I just want to see what comes up with when it codes

it. So I'm gonna unpause in a few minutes once I'm done doing this

probably. Actually,

I don't want to wait for it to do all this shit. It's just

r*******. Sorry, probably, it was just stupid.

Uhm,

code or do

HTML.

I don't want it in plain text.

Instead, can you please just write the copy

with formatting? I mean,

maybe it's best if you don't do it as an

artifact. We'll see what happens if it does that.

Okay,

so now it's gonna do it. So that's like,

uh, the artifacts are over here,

right? Fine,

I attribute the targets to real reasons your eyes are aging.

Discard the breakthrough signs of my oncology and I'll attribute it to a breakdown.

Why I change everything about your eye care. Doctor endorsed.

Product image.

It's not familiar. So,

basically, what's it doing? It's now

swiping off of Emma to

write that page. Okay, so,

let's save this. I'll

do it like this. Alright,

I'll put that.

You're like, prompt for Claude when it starts randomly

coding shit. Alright,

so I'll share the output for this one as

well.

Got the FAQs, all that kind of stuff, okay?

And between the two, I like the, uh, happy mammoth one more.

But I'll save this one as well. So what's cool here though is what

we did is we gave it, I don't know,

I don't think it actually went to the website, right?

So that's worthwhile. I could have told it to go to the website. Probably

would have been better, frankly. But if you don't want to do that,

or you want to create different outlines and structures, you can do a bunch,

and you have them, and then in the future, the website changes,

anything like that. You're like, hey, yo, here's the structure.

I have it. So, let's just take this product page copy

too. Right. Go, UEI

Theorem, sample,

demo style. All

right, cool. So,

to be very clear.

Give me a moment. All right,

so I did that one. But again,

this was cool because you could do it for anything, right? Like, I could

do the blood sugar supplement that we used as an example.

Oh,

this is one with the big idea. This is V2,

right? Okay. Now,

let's do a PVP.

For, uhm,

this blood sugar offer, it doesn't have a website yet.

Do the

exact same thing we did before,

please. Right, so this is the blood sugar one we did previously.

I'm hoping it doesn't start coding yet.

Don't start coding,

Claude.

There's still an edge for someone like me who knows

every single inside and out of it,

but like, it's a small edge.

And I mean, hopefully you're picking up on things throughout this course of,

like, best practices, little elements,

things like that, right?

So, yeah, it's pretty fascinating. So, honestly, I mean, if I'm you,

I'm really just doing this with Quad. I'm just taking product pages I like,

I'm trying to create outlines, and then I'm either just then giving it whoever

I'm writing the copy for, or my own brand,

or I'm giving it, like, a brief or whatever information and telling,

like, hey, write a new product page, and then I can always sort of

edit, copy chief, whatever,

which is really generally the same stuff as a VSL.

It's, like, common sense, right,

and it's funny, because I wasn't sure I was going to do this training,

how I was going to do it, but it's the exact same thing.

I feel like, what if I don't sell supplement stuff,

and not to sound like a demeaning,

but I feel like this always happens, right, people go,

but I do this. It's, like, it's the same f****** thing,

right, so it's, like, okay.

This is a, I've got, I've got some swipes in here,

honestly, I copy and pasted the plain text,

but, like, I don't, you don't really even need that, right,

like, when this is done here, which is about to be done,

uhm,

cool, there's a blood sugar thing, right, perfect,

let's go over here, uh,

Claude, new,

right, so,

I'm actually gonna start here, ah,

so I could write

on this here,

I'll do this one,

alright, so like, share

a product page for a brand, review it, create a structure,

okay? So this is coming from,

Let me close some of these other

pages up. This is like a portable infrared sauna.

I just found on Facebook and I've, like, saved, okay?

So,

I mean, it's a decent product page. I don't know if they're selling a

lot of these or not. It's, like, $2,000. Going back to,

like, what would you need, right? Like,

it's kind of long for a sauna. I don't know.

Maybe they're doing well with it. They have video ads in front of it.

Definitely would need, you know, Adios.

A decent video ad in front of this.

Maybe also even an advertorial as well.

In order to be set. But,

let's just do that same prompt.

Say that this was working. You knew this was working really well,

okay?

So, it's, like, okay, literally just the same thing,

you know? My retargeting audience.

So, maybe that's partially why. I mean,

actually,

I might have been saying that there was not a retargeting audience.

So, it should be the same thing, right? Okay.

Alright,

cool. So it's going to do this.

Alright.

Cool. Now,

I meant,

I removed the clarifying

thing, like a

dodo brain, while it's writing this.

If I'm ClarifyOn, I'm running this advertorial,

so I want my product page to be good,

but it doesn't need to be, like, as in-depth. It's

gonna

be better Honestly,

too, you know what I might do? Ah, sorry,

hold up a second.

Cause it talks more about the stuff here.

So I might use the advertorial page.

So now,

using a similar prompt

for this different product,

should just be that. Okay? So, let's

see.

Here's your sauna. Oh, hey, look at that. I'm

going to analyze it.

No, it's And

we're going to use that other thing we did.

I don't need to do code

or do HTML.

Oh

my god, would you look at that. I've got to do product page, okay.

I'm going to pause for a minute and come back here. Okay,

cool. So. Sorry, paused to get my computer for a minute.

I'm like, wondering what else you need. Like,

what I'm going to do is you're going to have links to a bunch

of example PDPs. So you can see the difference,

right? And it's going to be kind of what I said before. I guess

I'll finish with this. Like Primal Queen.

Nailing it. Got to like, Thank you.

10 million plus a month from what I heard. Great design.

Kind of like Emma. Would love to model off of this for,

you know, a more Yukon-ish brand.

Uhm,

cool. You got it, right? And I think,

you know, what I would do. Especially if you've got the,

well, if the PDP is brief that you've got. You know,

you can, I don't think there's one magic thing. I,

I, I guess it's hard for me. People always, what's the one thing?

What's the one product page I should swipe? It's like, I don't know.

I think that's honestly one of my biggest takeaways are biggest like things that

I think about in 2025 is that there's

not like,

you just have to test stuff. Like my confidence level is lower today,

even though I'm way better at marketing than I was even two years ago,

three years ago, five years ago, a year ago, the better I get,

the less confidence I have in any one thing working.

But paradoxically, More stuff I put out tends to work probably today than ever

before. So how could that be?

It's because I don't, it's not that the confidence,

it's not that I think most things will bomb.

It's that I don't know confidently what

the best thing is. There's so much nuance and context,

right? And that's something, one of the things we've been going through here.

Died. The truth is,

a lot of different things will work. This would probably work for UD Ice

or that blood sugar supplement or whatever else,

right? This would probably work for that.

The Happy Mammoth thing would probably work for that. This page,

frankly, if you update the design,

could kind of work, probably wouldn't work as well.

So I think there's like judgment that gets used. Here,

but like, you know,

basically like if a mindset unlock for you,

I sort of got to keep burying gems like an hour into these videos,

but like a mindset unlock for somebody who is earlier or really anybody

is like, accepting that it's virtually impossible,

you're going to pick the perfect funnel structure,

copy or anything like that. There's always going to be something that could be

better. So it's like, get,

you know, get stuff out there. But if it's, if it's, if it's good,

if it's like a solid, like basically try and hit doubles and occasionally

you'll just end up paying a home run. That's what I'm trying to say,

okay? We try and hit home runs,

we strike out all the My baseball analogy for international,

sorry, deal with it, go watch a baseball game and play. Figure it out.

Okay. Um, so you'll have examples of different PDPs.

It's funny. That's because originally I got all these examples cause I was like,

I'm going to do a quad project that turns PDPs and I could do

that, but I don't think you need it. I would just do it the

way I did in this video. Find examples you like.

Here's fine. Especially with this because again,

the swipe means different. It's different than a VSL.

It's like, you're just taking the structure, but if you give it a brief,

it's not going to be such a swipe that like,

you're like, Oh God, this is dumb. It's like,

cause you're trying to get the outline of the structure. So it's doing the

structure. That's the part you're extracting. That's a really important part.

Okay. There's the PDP you like.

You extract to like the structure outline model and you give it either a

link or a brief of the new thing. And you say,

okay, using this structure, I like create this new thing and it's going to

do it every time. Like, so yeah,

you can create a cloud project, like basically you could take all these different

outlines, give a cloud project and be like dealer's choice.

And that's cool. But really,

I would rather just pick something I really like, let's say go model,

basically extract,

take the new information you have. and now create a

thing that models that same structure, but for the new product,

new offer, new brand, whatever it is, okay? Uhm, and so again, you've got

examples, short, long, medium,

I'll add in clarify on, I'll add a few other things into here.

Uhm,

and I think

that covers product Purpose of them, and then modeling a structure that works,

then there isn't anything else, and it's like, you understand the purpose,

you understand when it's going to be long or short, and you go to

create one, once you know that context, then find

something that is working, that looks good, even if it's not working,

if it looks good, structurally, I mean, ideally,

you know it works, because it means it's got a lot of elements, it's

in a similar vertical. Bye-bye. But like,

good to go, right? Uhm,

so there you go. Alright. This was faster than I thought it was going

to be, because I really think this is just the way to do it

in 2025. In the summer of 2025.

If it changes, I'll update RBC2 and let you know,

if it's within the next year. Cool,

thank you.
