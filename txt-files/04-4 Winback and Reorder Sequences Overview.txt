Okay, let's go into Winback and reorder campaigns.

So,

pretty self-explanatory. I've got a sample reorder campaign

for a supplement company, and then two sample Winback sequences,

one for a supplement company,

one for kind of a biz-op type thing.

We're gonna open up the, Supplement one,

right? Here, the idea is essentially,

Somebody's a one-time buyer.

We want them to become a multiple-time buyer,

right? And, how are we gonna do that?

Well, we're gonna get them to, hopefully,

order again. And we're gonna tell them,

about,

you know, why,

why they should, right? Essentially, we're gonna tell them,

And there's some commonalities. I'll create a document for this.

You're making progress. You'll

make even more progress if you keep going.

If you don't keep going,

you'll lose progress.

Backtrack. Right? That's really all we're doing in a reorder sequence.

So, it's like a blood sugar, right? Time for you to reorder.

Keep your blood sugar progress going. Okay?

These were written by Claude, based off of some other reorder sequences,

too. You know, you're doing something that most people with blood sugar concerns

never do, first name. You're actually taking consistent action.

And that consistency is exactly why the cellular glucose transport restoration works

so well. This is kind of weird phrasing, because I just gave it the

brief for blood sugar, but it's okay.

Overall, it's alright. Um, here's what's happening inside your body right now.

Those tiny Glut4 transporters. The microscopic doors that let glucose into your cells are

getting stronger and more efficient every day you take the formula.

So, again, hypothetical blood sugar supplement we sort of,

uh, did during RBC2. It's just like,

we're telling them, hey, you know, you're, you're doing something awesome.

You're great. I make them feel good about it.

You're a consistent person, right? Um,

that's smart. here. Here's what's happening, right? Your body's changing,

right? You're on your way to even better results. But here's the thing,

you're probably about a week away from running out of your current supply.

And I want to make sure there's no gap in your cellular transport support.

Again, this is a weird, this is weird verbiage, but that's because of the

weird brief for this, or whatever, the weird mechanism. Um,

and this is coming from the doctor in this case, right? So,

the hypothetical doctor. Because after 18 years of treating diabetic patients,

I've learned that consistency is everything. And when it comes to blood sugar management,

to your next month's supply, do these things.

The patients who see the most dramatic improvements in their A1c levels are the

ones who never let their cellular glucose transport support lapse.

Transport support lapse. Again,

the name is really bothering me, so maybe I'll change it.

Just like Margaret, don't let the gap in your routine undo your progress you've

made to your continued health. Feel free to call us.

So you notice the timing, right? You're sending it.

Like, seven days before you think they're going to run out.

So you can have uninterrupted service. Okay,

three days before you think they're going to run out. Don't let your progress

plateau. Your cellular glucose stores and you continue to support.

You're probably down to your last few days of your glucose transport formula.

Why is it calling it glucose transport formula? I

need to share this thing important with you. The biggest mistake I see patients

make isn't starting wrong, it's stopping too soon.

Here's what happens when you stop supporting your cellular glucose transport system.

The tiny doors have been getting stronger and more efficient,

start to weaken again. The inflammation that was being controlled begins to return.

Your cells slowly go back to struggling. It's like stopping physical therapy just when

your muscles are getting stronger. Good news, you can avoid this completely by simply

maintaining your consistent routine. Most of our patients order when they have about 3

days left, that way their new supply arrives right when they need it.

To reorder now, do this stuff. Remember,

Margaret didn't see her best breakthrough until here, and neither did Robert or Linda.

It works, but with consistency, don't stop just when your body is saying it's

tried. This is actually a really efficient messaging,

or sorry, effective messaging, because it's sort of like,

hey, you were just at the point of turning the corner,

keep going. I mean, hopefully it's true for whatever you're selling, but like,

right? Avoid a blood sugar

setback, don't let your glucose door slam shut.

Okay, you're probably on your last dose, you know,

you understand what happens next if you don't reorder immediately.

The Solar Transport Breakdown begins for 72 hours,

those, you know, doors start to lose their efficiency,

inflammation comes. This guy is a little bit aggressive,

scaring them, right? Seems to pattern a lot.

People are doing great,

they forget it's busy, forget to reorder. Suddenly they're back to where they started,

frustrated, disappointed. Feel like they wasted their progress,

don't let this happen to you. Reorder

now, all that. The day they run out,

here's your last chance, and they're throwing a 20% off,

right? Hey, last chance, you're gonna take your last dose,

you're about to lose the support, you don't need to,

save 20%. You know,

don't let things go back to the way they were, okay?

So,

like I said, pretty, pretty simple,

it's about purpose.

Or, I guess messaging.

Like, you're making progress, you're making more progress if you keep going,

if you don't keep going, you know.

I guess you could put as a bonus here,

be a very consistent person.

Really commits to things, aren't you?

Right? So that's it,

because it's not super hard. I'm going to look at win-back sequences.

So we'll look at blood sugar first, and we'll look at a, uhm, like

a sass one second. So this would be like 45 seconds.

45 days after the last order, so say they got the reorder email,

like, you know, at day 30,

or something like that, day 33, 35,

this is going to come like 10 to 15 days later. You know,

this is for a compliant blood sugar supplement,

so it's come back to balanced blood sugar, the sexiest name.

No, but it's fine for the example.

It's been about six weeks since

your last order. I have a feeling you might be noticing some changes.

Maybe your energy isn't as steady as it was. Perhaps those afternoon crashes are

creeping back in. You might even be seeing your blood sugar readings climb again.

Here's what's happening. Without continued support, those GLUT4 transporters,

the cellular glucose stores we worked so hard to repair, have started to weaken

again. The inflammation that damages your cellular transport system has returned.

Your cells are struggling to absorb glucose sufficiently once again. Here's the good news.

You can restore your cellular glucose transport function faster the second time around.

Because your body remembers what optimal cellular function feels like.

Tell me to get back on track. I'm offering you 20% off when you

restart today. Use this code. Why do you restart now?

Margaret's story is instructive here. She stopped her formula after six weeks.

Life got busy. She was feeling better. Within a month,

her fasting glucose climbed back from 110,

sorry, climbed from 110 back to 160. When she restarted,

she was back to optimal levels in just three weeks. Your cellular transport system

wants to work properly again. Give her the support it needs.

Click here to restart. So I'm going to talk about the messaging on this

one. These are also really effective. I learned this all the way back in

the day with my, uh, first supplement company. It's sort of like,

hey, notice me something. Like essentially,

sometimes with like a product, and especially like a supplement,

it's like somebody might feel like they don't really notice a big difference,

but then they stop and suddenly they have like a shitty day or a

shitty week or they feel more tired,

they're dragging butt a little more, they're less clear,

whatever it is, and they kind of like don't put it together until you're

like, hey, you're noticing,

you're feeling like you're dragging butt, you're a little less clear,

lower energy, like you stopped taking the supplement about two weeks ago.

Like, it seems like maybe the one big change you made, maybe that's why,

so if you want to feel good again, just get back on the supplement.

Hey, it works. It works well.

Uhm,

so it's really like the messaging here, right? And the other cool part of

it is like, you know, by the way,

when you come back on it, you're going to get great results,

right? It's not too late, you didn't screw it all up.

Your body remembers, you'll actually get results potentially even faster,

or even better when you get back on it. And the discount,

I like just leaving a discount for winbacks. Honestly,

frankly, I might even be more aggressive. But

here, right, month two is when most breakthroughs happen.

I mean, I only do this if somebody, You can also make this more

generic, like your next, next, your next month is, you is when most breakthroughs

happen. Or this month. You know,

this is also a, a, a nice piece of messaging,

kind of similar to that. So the first one's like,

hey, you might feel crafty since you stopped taking this,

so why don't you start taking it again. This one's like, hey,

you were about to have that breakthrough, you were just around the corner,

and you stopped. Like,

right? Uhm.

This only really works for people if they only bought one month supply,

but you can also modify it for someone like, oh, in month four,

month three, you know, whatever it is. And this sort of just explains why,

right? Why is the next month magic? You know, you stopped right before month

two. You know,

oh man, I stopped right before I was fully optimized, here's a discount,

you can get more. Then I would frankly,

for a win back, go up to a more aggressive pricing,

like 40% off, 30% off, whatever it is, because otherwise,

I don't want to lose them as a customer, you know?

I want to try and keep them, because the longer you keep them buying,

the more likely they are to stay long-term, especially if the product's good and

you just need them to stay on it a bit longer. You know,

I'm offering 40% off, offering,

authorizing, you know,

kind of same with messaging, you stop before a big breakthrough,

uhm, you're probably feeling like,

on it, don't go through another year of this,

like, why am I doing it, why am I giving it away for you?

You know, I see what happens if you'll miss it,

right? Don't want it to be you, get it.

And the kind of the final thing, hey, like, you're just kind of spires,

okay? So it's pretty simple and easy.

And I did one back for the arbitrage thing for that same,

uh, what are that thing?

It was called, like, the, um, the asset finder

pro that we did, uh, the promotion emails for.

Now I must pretend it's like, um,

it was a good subscription, right? 97 dollars a month.

Okay, 14 days after cancellation. We're offering them to stuff.

Hey, you know, I'm worried you're falling back into all the patterns.

Don't slip back. I'm doing my new research track. Hey,

I'm concerned. It's been two weeks since you cancelled your asset pro finder subscription

and I'm worried you're falling back into old patterns to keep people trapped.

Here's what I mean. Right now you're probably thinking you can just figure out

profitable Airbnb markets on your own. Maybe you're back to spending hours on Zillow

trying to manually calculate cash flow potential. I'm just going through endless Airbnb listings.

You guys see the occupancy rates and I get it. I really do.

When you're feeling the pinch financially, 97 dollars a month feels like a lot.

But here's what I'm worried about. You're slipping back into income gap thinking instead

of asset. I'd probably,

you know, gap building. Again, I just give this the brief.

I might say assets, you know, asset solution building or something like that,

right? Um, you're training your time.

Instead of controlling your time, you're doing exactly what the rig system wants.

Uh, you know, I even gone these past two weeks.

Like, here's Sarah and Marcus, Jennifer, I've had success.

They're building these assets before. Those, while you're back to manual research.

Look, I don't want to see you become another what-if story, so I'm going

to make this as easy as possible for you to get back on track.

Come back today and get 25% off for your next three months.

That's just 72, 75 a month or 77 dollars.

Use this code. Here's a math that should scare you.

Manual market research. 20 hours to make me find one decent market.

Asset finder probe. Complete market analysis. Another two hours to make my profitability.

One good property you find pays for years of the subscription.

One property you missed because you didn't have the data to cost you $50,000

potential cash flow. I'm not trying to pressure you.

I'm trying to protect you from falling back into the time,

train, trap, the key people stuck in the virus forever. Right,

it's a really nice email. Cause it's like,

hey, I'm looking out for you. People,

especially in like, bizarre, there's more of a mindset thing. Like,

you know, or you falling back at your own mind. I said, oh, gosh,

shit, I am. You're right. You know, I should, I need to get back

on this. That's good. So it's strong email. Okay. Don't let this just pull

you back in. It's kind of the same messaging here.

More social proof. You know, assets still here.

The book kind of like, what a story.

How's the manual research going? Accurricular s- success,

right? And the story games,

like, don't become another, what a story. What if I say consistent,

right? It's kind of calling out that lack of confidence and that feeling of

people, like, oh, I give up on everything, like, hey,

don't be that person, right? What if you can, what's that of that?

You can be doing these things, right? Um.

And then same thing there. I probably threw like, uh,

30% off plus bonuses. ounces. 8 8 8 8 9 is I'm really trying

to give you everything I can to bring from between another almost made a

story. It's been three weeks since you cancelled,

through all this stuff. I can't let it,

I can't just sit here and watch it happen. So here's what I'm doing.

50% off your next three months, just 4850, a month instead of $97, plus

I'm throwing in this random bonus.

Why am I probably giving this away? Again,

you know, I've seen people who make this mistake- and

they suffer, you know, you're gonna get it for 40-50 a month,

it's less than all of these things,

right? Like, it's- it's dimensionalizing it, it's less than dinner out,

taking a gas, half a cable bill, a few coffee shop visits.

Uhm,

but it's also the difference between building a cashflow asset portfolio and a state

trapped in the research here is forever. This is my final intervention.

If tomorrow disappears, you know how I've been doing .

So,

not rocket science, but they're cool. They're cool,

they're, they're effective, so definitely saying to add in if you're own your own

business or if you're,

you know, writing for a business or whatever it is.

So now, with this done,

I'm gonna create a cloud project, show you how to use that to just

generate all of these, and then we'll be completely with email.

Alright, thank you.
