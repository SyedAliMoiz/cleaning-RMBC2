All right.

This ad format style, really, really effective.

Um, not universal

because it, it, it relies on needing kind

of a physical location to go to,

but you can get creative with this.

So essentially what this style

of video does is somebody goes into a retail store,

into a retail environment, finds either the exact product

or an alternative or a competitor to the product, highlights

how expensive, how bad of a deal it is,

and then shows that there's a much better deal on TikTok

shop or on just through a TikTok ad going to a Shopify store

or to an offer I

TikTok shop and buying, going Clark the next one,

free and for shipping view.

That's all.

So again,

this really great hook might get fired for exposing this.

So you kind of, you feel like you,

you know, something you shouldn't know.

It feels forbidden. People like forbidden things.

People like knowing things they shouldn't know.

So it's really playing on that in the hook.

Really quick video. This is 15 seconds.

He's in Sephora, I believe.

And again, there's this beauty product on TikTok shop

that's a much better deal than

what we were getting at Sephora.

So again, if you're watching this, most women, they're like,

this is where they gotta buy things.

Now they know this is actually a crappy deal.

So it puts it in, you know,

puts it really in perspective for them.

And so you could do this though

for really any product, right?

It's like, find where a competitor, find

where an alternative is sold,

highlight the disparity in the deal.

Um, you know, you could even do this if you're

on online only product.

It's like, hey, if you've been, you know,

thinking about buying this product over

here, check it out over here.

So there's different ways you can do this to get the same,

uh, same point across the same value.

But this is a, a really, really effective framework,

a really effective format that just does, does very,

very well, consistently across the board.
