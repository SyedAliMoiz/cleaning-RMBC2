All right, so you've made some videos.

Let's actually dive into an ad account.

Let's talk about the creative testing process

because this is something that, one of the,

the single biggest factors

that dictates whether you're gonna be

successful or not successful.

I audit so many ad accounts every single month,

and the one common thing I see in successful advertisers

versus not successful ones,

and unfortunately there's a lot more not successful than

successful, is creative testing.

It's one, just having some

of infrastructure in place to test creative.

And the other is really, uh, being methodical about it,

having a system for testing.

Then what do you do once you've tested that creative?

What's the next step from an iteration perspective,

from an ascension perspective?

So, we're gonna look in this ad account

and, uh, this is actually a relatively simple structured ad

account 'cause it just gets results.

It's a very simple business.

Higher ticket business does incredibly well.

We spent over $3 million with them, um, since we,

we've been running on TikTok.

And, uh, and the machine they've built is just very simple,

but very effective.

It's creative testing every single week

from those creatives.

Winners get moved into a smart performance campaign and, uh,

and also vertically scaled in the creative testing campaign.

Now, there's a lot of other campaigns

that we've actually launched

for 'em that are paused right now.

They're going through some, um,

they're opening three new locations,

so we're reworking the budgets a little bit.

So when you look at this account, there's actually, um,

quite a few things that are just on pause here.

So we typically would also have a, uh,

a smart performance campaign that's using, uh, cost caps,

so using manual bidding, and this one's the lowest cost.

We would typically have some other other stuff going on,

some other other scaling campaigns,

some other testing campaigns.

But for right now, we've just focused on keeping the budget

around 150,000 a month.

And, um, and that's really just using the bread

and butter of this creative testing,

creative testing campaign, and this

smart performance campaign.

So these are really the, the two, um,

the two campaigns that are running.

And again, we're gonna dive into

the creative testing campaign.

But yeah, this is a, a smart plus, uh, lead gen campaign

and all the winning creative gets put into,

into this campaign.

And it just because we're fueling it every week

with new winners, the performance stays the same.

And that's the big thing, whether you're looking at TikTok,

whether you're looking at meta, whatever the channel is,

as they move more and more towards Advantage Shopping p max,

smart performance, right?

These campaigns are gonna do a lot of stuff that we used

to have to do as advertisers.

Now I also wanted to clarify that of course,

there's gonna be accounts where, you know,

you wanna run other things, you wanna have more control

your, your structure, whether you're using a CBO

or a BO, whether you're doing your own audiences,

your own bidding.

Cool, that, that's fine.

There's, there's lots of places for that,

and that's still, you can beat the,

you can beat the platform in a lot

of instances if you're really good.

But for a lot of accounts,

I'm seeing this more and more

and more if you can just give it the platforms enough high

quality data for your exact customer,

and you can create enough creative on a weekly basis

to fuel the machine running those kind

of high budget advantage.

Shopping smart plus campaigns, uh,

produces really, really great results.

So for a lot of you,

that's gonna be like one of the best paths forward.

So right here we have a creative testing campaign.

And within this, again, this client, every single week,

our goal is to launch new creative.

Now, uh, there's been periods where they kind of, not slack,

but they fall off a little bit.

Periods where they're testing more

creative on a weekly basis.

What's really important is

that you're consistently doing it.

Uh, ideally you do have a cadence,

whether it's every Monday, every other Monday

that you're sticking to and you're trying to test, you know,

I would say at least four new

creatives in those time windows.

The more you test, the more

likely you're gonna find winners.

Ideally, you're batting between like two 50

and three 30, meaning for every, you know,

four creatives you test, you're gonna find one winner.

That that's kind of the, the,

the pace we like to shoot for at a minimum.

Again, if you're just getting started this,

you'll probably be more like, you know, one in 10,

maybe one in eight, uh,

but ideally when it gets to the kind of one in four,

one in three where you're finding something

that can be put into that, that scaling campaign.

Now within here, what you're gonna see is these are all

individual ad groups, meaning they're their own audiences.

Every batch of creative gets tested under its own ad set,

and this ad set is our winning audience.

So once you've identified the top performing audience,

that then becomes your control

that you're gonna use when you're

launching a new creative test.

So you're gonna come in, you're gonna create a new,

uh, new ad group.

That ad group is gonna use your winning

targeting and winning audience.

And then under that ad group, you're going

to put the creative that you want to test in there.

I want to clarify here, when you're testing new creative,

uh, there, there's kind of two schools of thought here,

and we've gone back

and forth with this over the years too,

is whether you do one-to-one,

meaning every single ad group has one creative,

so you're totally controlling the budget,

ensuring a hundred percent of the budget

goes to that creative.

The other way to do it is to batch.

And we actually do both of these in this account.

Uh, so if we, for example, had multiple versions of this ad,

like different hooks, we'd put all of 'em into one ad group

because the, the creative is similar enough

that we're not worried about, uh, too much budget going

to one and a concept not being tested enough.

What some people do is they'll

throw all their creative under one eye group for a test,

but it, they're so different.

The angles are different, everything's different,

that you're not gonna get a true apples, apples test

and you're probably not getting enough,

enough spend in every concept.

So ideally you either do one-to-one like this,

or if you're gonna put multiple creative under an ad group

like this one

That I'm gonna show you, then they're all gonna

be really, really similar.

So, for example, these are all the exact same video.

They just have different hooks,

different setups, different frameworks.

So we've already kind of tested this core video,

and now we know what we're testing is kind

of slightly variations of that.

And, and we're fine putting multiple under one ad group.

So that's really, really important.

Now, what happens is when you test lots of creative,

this is what you're gonna find, right?

It's like, hey, you're gonna find winners.

And this is so important. If you're not testing enough,

you're gonna just hope that, hey,

like let's say if you just launched with this creative,

you're hoping that oh, 45, 40 is my my norm, that sucks.

But because we test consistently, we know, okay, we're kind

of averaging in the teens, teens, teens, we have a baseline,

and then we find these outliers

and we find these outliers like this one

that actually the first week or so is getting two, $3 leads.

We can do a few things.

One is we can scale it vertically,

meaning we're gonna increase the budget directly in here.

Really, really important. A lot

of people when they do creative testing, they're like, okay,

I'm gonna move this creative to the scaling campaign

and not touch it here, or they turn it off.

It's like, no, if it's making you money, keep spending

and push it, push it, push it, okay?

You also want to ascend it,

meaning you're gonna take this ad

and you're gonna move that ad to your scaling campaign,

which for us is this campaign right here,

which is a smart plus campaign.

Uh, which if you're meta advertisers

like Advantage Shopping, right?

TikTok does all the stuff for you.

The targeting, the the, they,

they put together the creative, all that good stuff.

But within here, I would then move the winner into this.

So I would just, you know, I have all these videos in here

and I would just add this one.

So now I have 18 videos running, and

because that's a winner, it's gonna continue

to fuel the performance of this campaign.

So those are the the two things

that I'm doing from a scaling perspective

within the creative testing.

The final thing here is we are going

to treat creative as modular, not monolithic.

And the next video we're gonna dive into what

that actually means and how that's actually executed.
