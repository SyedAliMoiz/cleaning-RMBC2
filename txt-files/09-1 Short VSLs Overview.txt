Hello, welcome to the section on shorter BSLs.

This is an interesting section to do.

I can't explain why in some of the videos, or the video,

there's one video that's over an hour long. What you'll find is that there's

a ton of examples, um, with different sort of short BSL scripts,

and we break down a bunch of them, wash a bunch of them. And

I can't go through with some different structures. You'll also see that I was

using Claude to create these structures.

Um, and then kind of modifying them in real time in the video to

create kind of outlines. But one thing I want to note,

now that I've done the section, and that one should pay attention to,

is how, you know,

I'm giving Claude these scripts,

telling it to create outlines. And then,

you know,

I modify based on what I'm seeing. Um,

I just want to make sure you think about that skill as well,

right? Because you have the skill of like,

taking things you like. Hey Claude,

break it down to the specific structure. Perfect.

Make it more universal. Great. Like,

you know, you can create sort of tempo salins,

things like that. And we're doing this, not just from- manually writing copy.

We're doing it because we're going to then feed it into Claude as we're

creating VSLs. I really think once we get to that actual creation,

copy creation section, a lot of things in this course will click together for

you if they haven't already. Um, but we'll make that point.

Enjoy the example as there's lots to look at.

You'll kind of see brands so you can always go look and find more

from. And, uh, that should be good.

Thank you.
