Alright, so let's look at medium-length VSLs now,

uhm,

for Airbnb arbitrage. I mean, honestly, like, you know,

you saw the long-form one, we created the script,

we did some additional leads for it,

which I have here as a PDF in this form.

I don't want to have to copy the document every time, I mean,

you know, the Google Docs are in the long-form.

If you want those versions, these are the PDFs,

uhm,

so what can I do here? Well, hopefully, assuming Clod's working normally now,

because as you may recall, at the end

of that long-form Airbnb one, it wasn't, one of the most obvious things I

could do is I could just,

and I could do this, honestly, in that same Clod project, or I can

do it here on to the medium length one.

Let me go, okay,

like, here's a DSL I wrote for an

Airbnb arbitrage, uh,

coaching program.

Uh,

can you take this and do a version that is 18?

It's long,

uhm,

keep the three options for the openings,

since each video would only have one of those options,

so that wouldn't affect the overall,

uhm. That

should be taken into account.

If you do this medium length

version, thanks. Well,

I think the clock just skews a little bit. I think it's a little

bit longer than it is, so. Okay, this is one obvious way I can

do this. It should be basically the same.

PSL, just more succinct.

I don't know why it's giving me these weird

other hooks. But,

that's actually not a huge deal, because I can just

use the hooks from the long VSL.

If I needed to cut them down a little bit, I would.

So,

again, guys, it feels weird. Cloud makes updates,

sometimes things get a little wonky. But overall,

this shouldn't be, like, you know,

most of the time. Nah,

this is gonna be weird, actually.

So I start with this guy. This guy, Rick. This guy,

Rick, he was brilliant. Restore restrain,

I could. I'm gonna stop it. Okay.

They're, like,

multiple models, and you're screwed if you don't.

Let's just, like, do the same prompt here in Gemini,

and see if Gemini is less screwy right now.

Just

doing a version that strategically cuts

down things to make it fit the 18-minute.

Let me try this one more time. Let me try this prompt here again.

Okay,

so, I'm actually, while it's doing this, I'm going to try this prompt again.

I'm just going to do the same thing I told Gemini. Same,

so let's see if it does it better this time or not.

I mean, I honestly could do it, I could do it in a quad

project, right? I mean, I wonder what happens if I just do it in

a normal quad. Uhm,

it should do the same thing in the medium-length project. But I mean, honestly,

I could just also upload it into quad.

Let's see, now if it gets wonky again, then we know something's up with

quad Sonic 4 right now. And I could honestly go do 3.7 or something

like that, right? I mean, to be honest with you, 3.7 should do fine.

I think 4 just does longer outputs, so that's one of the things I

like about it. Let's see, okay.

So

I kept these as is, as I said.

And so really, I'm honestly not going to spend a ton of time going

through this. I'm just going to,

like, share it with you, because again, it should basically be the same.

PSL,

which is shorter, except for, not really,

because it really shortens.

I'm going to move this down a lot, let's

see, 3-4 minutes, 4-5 minutes,

so say 3, 4, 7,

10, Nah,

I guess not, it just feels shorter. I guess it's the right amount of

time. Alright, never mind.

So I guess it's probably going to be like, it just feels so much

shorter when it's, like, Thank you. So

I'm

sort of keeping the leads as is, which is fine. All

right, cool. So it's doing a good job now. So the cloud project was

just being wonky. But I don't think it'll be wonky for,

if you want a different media length, VSL. So that's where we'll use it

real quick as an example here. Once this is done,

which it should be done in just a moment. All right.

Cool. So I'm going to copy this, can go,

why is everything in wonky

right now? Medium, why is it going in white?

Silver, medium length,

VSL example, pair, be,

be arbitrage. Let's see. Hopefully it's probably,

yeah, there you go,

okay, it's better. The whole internet's being wonky today.

So I'm going do that. This will be plot

inversion. Okay, so,

this is one way to do it.

One, two, cut down

is just the input, too, okay? Cool,

let's save that. Let's quickly look at what we would do Let's

look at the cloud project now, so. So

now, if I wasn't gonna do that, I might just do something like,

the brief.

I think if I'd like the long VSL, this is probably just how I

would do it, to be honest with you. But,

you know, for, like, simplicity's sake, let's just go, Arbitrage

pushing program,

this is for problem-aware people,

so we don't want to lead out

with the arbitrage.

Can you please give me the outline for a medium?

Let's actually make this one shorter.

I honestly, I would do the same thing for, like, even if I wanted

a 7 or 8 minute one. But, like, let's say that's 9

minutes total. Note the call to action will be

to book a call and get a roadmap,

not to, not to sell

the course. Or the program,

so, talk about the price,

Let's see what it does for that I

think this is going to be short because it's going to be 9 minutes

long. It's

honestly just writing it. Because

it's like 9 minutes, it's pretty short, so let's just look through it. What

I'm about to show you explains why every side hustle you've tried has failed,

and it has nothing to do with your work ethic, your intelligence, or even

how much money you started with. In fact, once you understand this hidden truth,

you'll realize you've been trying to solve the completely wrong problem this entire time,

and the solution is actually much simpler than you think,

but almost nobody talks about it. My name is Marcus Hayes,

and over the past 18 months, I've gone from a burnout logistics manager working

60-hour weeks to controlling over $2.3 million in cash flow and real estate assets

without owning a single property or having perfect credit.

Look, if you're watching this, you're probably like I was two years ago.

You're working harder than ever, but somehow getting further behind.

Maybe you've tried affiliate marketing, dropshipping, freelancing,

and they either didn't work or burned you out completely. You know the system

is rigged, your parents could buy a house. House and support a family on

one income. Meanwhile, you're college-educated, working longer hours and still living paycheck to paycheck.

But here's what I discovered that changed everything. You don't have an income problem,

you have an asset gap problem. And you've been trying to solve an asset

gap problem with income solutions. That's why everything you've tried has failed.

See, there's no such thing as being income-rich long-term,

because income requires trading your time, and you only have 24 hours in a

day. But being asset-rich, that's where real wealth comes from,

because assets make money while you sleep. The wealth you don't get rich from

paycheck to paychecks to get rich by accumulating assets.

But here's the problem. The system makes it almost impossible for regular people like

us to access these wealth-building assets. Want to invest in real estate?

You need $80,000 for a down payment, perfect credit,

massive income qualification. Want to start a real business?

You need a huge startup capital and years to build it. So we get

stuck trying income solutions, side hustles that require us to work more hours for

uncertain pay. It's still trading time for money. It's still the hamster wheel.

Stuck trapped in this exact cycle, I tried every side hustle you can imagine

and failed at all of them, lost thousands, feel like an idiot,

then I stumbled across something that changed everything. It's called the asset control method

and lets you regain operational control of cash-flowing real estate assets without the massive

barriers of traditional ownership. Instead of buying properties,

which require those huge down payments and perfect credit, you gain control of cash-flowing

assets through strategic partnerships with property owners.

You find property owners who want a stable, reliable income without management hedging tactics.

You lease their properties on a long-term basis, then operate them as short-term rentals,

capturing the cash flow difference. You get all the benefit of asset ownership,

passive income, scalability, wealth building without the traditional barriers.

This isn't just another way to make extra income. You're controlling assets that generate

cash flow, whether you're actively working or not.

This is your bridge from being income dependent to becoming asset rich.

In 18 months, I built a 15-unit portfolio,

generate over $12,000 in monthly passive income, these properties cash flowed from day one,

the landlord is loving the arrangement, and I'm finally building real wealth.

But here's the best part. I spend about five hours a week managing the

entire portfolio because I've systematized everything. Sarah,

a teacher from Phoenix, secured her first property in six weeks,

starting at $3,200. There's Mike, there's Jessica.

Landlord testimonial. Most time hustles fail because there's still income solutions disguised

as businesses. You stop working and the money stops coming.

But with the asset control method, you're building a portfolio. Portfolio of cashflow assets.

Each property becomes a mini business that operates whether you're working,

sleeping, or on vacation, the key is finding what I call hidden gem markets,

areas where there's strong rental demand,

but limited short-term rental supply, where everyone else fights over saturated markets.

You're building in areas where you have little to no competition.

This isn't about tricking landlords or finding loopholes.

This is about creating genuine win-win partnerships. Property owners get guaranteed rent,

professional management, and higher quality tenants. You get control of a cashflow asset.

without massive capital requirements. I've systematized everything from finding properties to landlord negotiations

to guest management. My students use the exact same templates,

scripts, and processes that took me months to develop and refine.

Look, yes,

more people are worried about this,

but most are doing it wrong. That's kind of weird how it just kind

of goes into the objection handling. That's

all they do.

You go from

systems

and automation

to just

hoarding

hot objections.

You are good to go. But we need a better transition.

Thinking

about it right now, it sounds too good to be true, and honestly, if

someone had told me this three years ago when I was failing at my

first side hustle, I probably would have been skeptical too,

so let Everyone's doing this now. You're probably thinking,

if this works so well, isn't everyone doing it now? Look, yes, more people

are learning about this, but most are doing it wrong. Competing in over-saturated markets

are creating bad partnerships with landlords. The right approach and the right markets with

the right systems, that's what separates success from failure. What about real regulations?

You may be wondering about the legal side of things. This is exactly why

we focus on responsible arbitrage and proper legal structures.

Everything we do is well-bored, benefits all parties,

and actually improves communities by maintaining properties at higher standards.

I don't have time, and I bet you're thinking, Marcus, I'm already overwhelmed.

When am I going to find time for all this? I get it,

you're already stretched thin, but here's the thing. You're going to spend your time

somehow. You can keep spending it making other people rich in your 9-to-5,

or you can invest some time building assets that will pay you for years

to come. What if I fail again?

Maybe you're thinking, what if this is just another thing I fail at? Trust

me, I failed at everything too before I figured this out.

The difference is, uh,

this time you won't be going into the loan, you'll have proven systems I'm

going to support, and a community of people doing exactly what you're trying to

do. That's much better, okay? So let's actually take this,

Put

V1 into here,

And we just need to take, Unique

mechanism, What if I fail again?

Okay.

And we can kind of read from here to continue on.

Look, I only share this with serious people who are ready to stop making

excuses and start building real wealth. You're tired of being stuck in the income

trap, and you're ready to start accumulating assets. I want to help you create

a free training where I break down exactly how the asset control method works,

show you the specific markets I'm targeting right now and walk you through the

exact process I use to secure these partnerships, what you get.

On this training, you'll get the complete hidden gem market analysis I use to

find profitable opportunities, my exact landlord partnership script that has an 85% success rate,

a breakdown of realistic costs and timelines so you know exactly what to expect,

and I'll show you how to identify your first potential property.

I will do these trainings a few times a year, and spots are limited

because I personally review every application to make sure we're working with serious people.

and if you look at your fit, you'll get access to schedule your session.

Two years ago, I was exactly where you are, frustrated,

stuck, and tired of trading time for money. Today, I wake up to money

deposited from guests who stayed while I slept. The difference?

I stopped trying to solve an asset gap problem with an income gap solution.

If you're ready to make the same shift, click below and let's talk. All

right,

So that's it. And of course,

we could add in,

right, like, cool, this is great, let's do this hook, let's do that hook,

blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, but hopefully it's pretty self-explanatory.

Pretty solid, right? Thank you,
