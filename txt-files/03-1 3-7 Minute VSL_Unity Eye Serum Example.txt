Alright, so, let's quickly kind of do a 3-7 minute version

VSL, uh,

for UDI serum,

this example. So we just got the same brief as before,

uh, but,

you know, we're doing it, we're just re-labeling it basically.

Uhm, you've already seen how I set up this cloud project in that section.

So, it's pretty easy.

This one I, I'm gonna say that the classic structure that we use in

the short and medium is gonna be less important. Uhm,

and this is kind of where, to be honest with you,

the brief is gonna, I'm curious to see,

Sorry,

I shouldn't have been brief. Uhm,

sort of like how important it is. So, let's just try it out here,

okay? Say,

a VSL brief for a skincare product,

uhm,

for 3-7 minute VSLs,

say, don't,

You might not need all of the information

in here. Right now,

I want 5

VSL concepts from you.

I want them to come from Dr.

Schilling as the spokesperson.

Set it up with Laura. And then,

honestly, if I was doing this, because usually,

going back to what's the purpose of these, it's usually to either go to

a landing page, but,

so, like, you know, or a VSL.

As long as it's a VSL. So, if it's going to the VSL,

You know, let's try him. Uhm.

Let's, let's assume the CTA is going to be to watch video.

Won't talk about brand or product at all.

Uh, go ahead and give me some concepts

now, please. Let's see,

I could take the Dr. Schilling stuff and, like,

from the Medium VSL, which I really liked, and put it on here.

So

this one's pretty on-the-nose. I don't know,

I have to confirm, Harvard actually does, one of these studies comes from Harvard.

It's

honestly, these are pretty similar to,

like, the short videos. VSLs or the ADHD kind of hook things we did,

so as we get into, like, medium and short length ones.

Coming up with having good

hooks out the gate is,

like, pretty helpful.

So, like, to be honest with you. To be honest.

I would probably. Go back.

Sorry, the seduction thing is when somebody was like. Basically,

uh. You can't do dating on quad.

This is years ago now. And I'm like, yeah, you can.

And then I was like, oh, I can't do it or something. So,

but it was like saved for some reason. So I type quad.

It takes me to this f****** dating thing.

It's actually really annoying. Uhm.

But. But, let's go back to our little hook generator thing.

We have the skin care hooks. Let's do.

I really like that mistake when it was. That. So I'm going to say.

Okay. These are good.

Let's use this hook first.

This is much

more. Please

outline the, I can probably tell what we're going for.

Let's do an ad that is 3 minutes and 30 seconds.

I don't know how to do that properly. Roughly 3 minutes and 30

seconds. Please outline it for me.

I still like the outline thing because it sort of makes me

double check and confirm if there's anything I want to tweak or change before.

So

this is pretty locked in with what you normally see,

which is where the- they're pretty mechanism heavy on these 3-7 minute ones. It

just

Thousands of women make the same costume mistake.

They spend $200, $300, even $400 on luxury eye creams.

They think that higher prices equals- higher price equals better results.

But here's what those salespeople don't tell you,

and what most doctors don't understand either. When you have crow's feet,

dark circles are sagging under your eyes. The problem isn't on the surface where

those expensive creams work. The real damage is happening deep below,

in your skin's structural foundation. See,

I've discovered that every sign of eye aging, the wrinkles,

the puffiness, the tired look, all stem from one root cause, collagen architecture breakdown.

Think of young skin like a perfectly woven fabric. Every collagen thread is organized

and tight, working together to create smooth, firm skin.

But as we age, those threads don't just disappear, they become loose,

tangled, disorganized. This happens at what we call the dermal-epidermal junction,

where the skin layers meet. When this foundation collapses,

it creates gaps and weaknesses. Blood vessels show through the thin structure,

causing dark circles. Fluid accumulates where organized support once existed.

Creating puffiness, and without that tight weave,

holding everything in place, wrinkles form and skin loses its snap.

This is why those $400 creams fail.

They're trying to fix a broken fabric, trying to fix broken fabric by adding

more fabric on top. But if the underlying weave is tangled and collapsed,

surface treatments can't rebuild the foundation. Whether you spend $50 or $500,

if the product doesn't target collagen architecture breakdown,

you'll keep getting disappointed. I've seen patients spend thousands trying to get every luxury

brand, every miracle cream, even getting procedures done,

but until you address the structural breakdown happening at the DEJ,

you're just treating symptoms, not the cause. But here's the breakthrough I've been working

on. There's a way to signal your skin to rebuild the collapsed architecture from

within, using specific compounds that can penetrate to the dermal-epidermal

junction and finally command your collagen threads to reorganize back into their proper structure.

clinical studies, we're seeing up to 39% reduction in just four weeks.

Not because we're adding more collagen, but because we're restoring the organized foundation that

makes collagen work properly. My patients are getting results that rival professional treatments,

but they're doing it at home for a fraction of what they're spending at

department stores. I put together a free presentation where I reveal exactly how the

structural renewal system works, the specific compounds that make it possible,

and why this changes everything about treating eye aging.

You'll discover why price has nothing to do with results when you understand the

real science behind lasting transformation.

Don't waste another dollar on expensive creams that can't fix what's actually broken.

Click the button below to watch my free presentation and learn the truth about

reversing eye aging at its source. This information is too important to keep to

myself, and there's no telling how long the presentation will stay available.

Click below and discover what really works. Okay,

so a few compliance things, like I'm reversing,

and clinical studies we would have to clean up.

But overall, frankly, it's good. I don't really have anything to change for that.

I would give that, I would test that for sure. So,

let's just save it. And basically, honestly,

we're going to do the short VSL, you know, for this eye serum.

But I could also be like, this is awesome,

now please do a 1 minute and 30 second version.

Even though that's not what the project's for, I want to check that out,

too. Right? I can still do a short version of it.

And then, again, I can just give it more hooks. In the brief,

good to go. I'll give you this conversation, so you have the kind of

prompt I did, right? Just tell it what you want, and you get it,

basically. Uhm, so.

I don't want to get stuck on that font.

So,

like, 3 to 7 minute VSL,

eye serum.

Bang. Boom, bang, bam. We'll save that into this 3 to 7 minute.

I probably should have it pretty easily here. There

we go. Saved. This video is pretty fast and short.

Let's just look at the, was it here? Here's

a short version. Same hook.

I see thousands of women waste portions of luxury eye cream because they can't

fix what's actually broken. Still does collagen architecture breakdown.

It's faster. I've seen how to, discovered how to signal your skin to reorganize

the structure from within. Again,

I can't, we can't say, could we? Clinical studies. We're not doing clinical studies

with the ingredient. We're seeing the 39% reduction.

Pretty good for your presentation. It's a little bit more to the point.

But, frankly,

maybe even better. And that's something you would test. You would test a version

that has more of the mechanism,

explains more of that, or it's a version that has less mechanism and is

more to the point. So, I'm gonna go ahead and share,

or save that as well. I'll put this in here, even though it's a

short VSL, and we'll do short VSLs as well.

Now, this is a fast one because, frankly,

these projects make it so easy. I don't know,

you know, if you know what works for a good copy, like,

and you study stuff, it's hard for me to tell you more than that.

So, yeah, like,

short, I'm actually just gonna cheat. I don't know where to put this.

Let's put shorter version. You know what I'm gonna do?

Uh,

make a copy. Let's say,

shorter version, make

a copy of this, and I'll replace this one with the shorter version.

And, there you go.
