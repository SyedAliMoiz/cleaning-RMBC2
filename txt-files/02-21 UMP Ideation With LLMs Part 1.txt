All right, hello again.

So, as promised, in this video I'm going to be sharing a prompt

and process for generating unique mechanism ideas

with large language models. There are

actually a lot of ways you can do this, which is really cool,

and in the past one of the main ways I did this was with

Clod projects Clod projects are still cool

and still a viable way of doing it But there are

some other Options now that I think are also pretty cool and powerful

So let's jump in.

First of all, I'm going to show you the prompt, okay?

Should highlight this or something Okay Today,

I want your help coming up with as many unique mechanism ideas for a

Product in the blank space,

right? I'll show you, you know, like so for a product in the Airbnb

arbitrage space the specific product is Coaching

program a community that shows people how they can Just lease

a property long-term and then manage it as a short-term

rental with the property owner's consent, okay?

I've attached a research brief that will help you understand the market we were

speaking to. Can we guess what that's gonna be?

It's gonna be our unified research document that we created

with clod. So if you have gone,

gone through these in order, and you went through the process of the

product-market awareness research, the competitor research,

the psychographic research, and we created that unified research document,

uhm, that's where this is gonna help shine,

one of the places. Here's a quick overview of how to understand unique mechanisms

in the road of direct response and D2C copy.

This is a copy and paste of the mechanism stuff we looked at in

the last video in the mechanism section. One

ver- one thing to pay very careful attention to is the levels of product-market

awareness we are focusing on. This is important because the UMP and UMS need

to speak to our prospects where they are at.

In other words, if the main market segment we are targeting is problem-aware,

it wouldn't make sense to have the UMP and UMS speak to the people

who are product-aware or most-aware. Please go ahead and get started now.

So, I just showed you this example of Airbnb arbitrage,

right? So, I did this in a bunch of different,

kind of, LLMs so you could see results.

And what we're going to be doing as we

go through these is we're going to take things that we like,

I'm trying to keep the screen,

sorry guys, I'm trying to keep, like, the screen size sort of smaller so

that if people watch on mobile they're not,

like, not able to read anything because they'll consume stuff on mobile,

although I'm, like, a boomer, I'm like, I don't know why,

uhm, so let's try and Have

these things sort of side by side But let's start With

Gemini So I'm actually gonna do it,

show you an output in Poe The reason why I'm gonna show you in

Poe is because I started running it Deep Research,

so

I basically uploaded, like, a Claude Unified Research Output for AirBnB Arbitrage

And I ran the prompt, right? AirBnB Arbitrage,

do this And I had to do it in Deep Research, okay?

As you can imagine, Deep Research was Pretty

deep It was cool,

actually But,

pretty, uh, you know, in-depth, okay?

And then what I'm gonna do, in order to not make it It's annoying,

I'll just put stuff in this document So while I was doing that,

I was like, well, let me just try a regular Gemini 2.5 Pro Uhm,

and so I did that in Pro Simultaneously, or sorry,

in Po Simultaneously Same prompt,

same Claude Unified Research Output Okay,

so let's see what it came up with here This is just,

uh, the part where it's, like, thinking Okay I'm gonna

read all of them, and reserve your judgment until we get through more of

the stuff here, okay? Idea 1,

the Partnership Pitch Protocol This mechanism focuses on overcoming the single biggest

perceived barrier, getting the landlord to say yes Unique mechanism of the problem,

the real reason you're stuck. You've been thinking about this all wrong You see

the landlord as an obstacle, a gatekeeper you have to somehow trigger-convince.

This mechanism This adversarial approach puts you on the defensive from the start,

and is why you either get rejected or are too scared to even try.

You're pitching a liability, not an asset.

Now, I just said to reserve judgment,

but I'm gonna judge.

I already don't like this unique mechanism.

Can you think of why I don't like this unique mechanism of the problem?

know that this isn't live, so,

but I'm giving you a minute to shout it out to your computer.

I don't like the unique mechanism of the problem, because despite what I said,

it's really talking to people who are highly

product aware, right? I want

to show you, what I'm talking about.

I'll remind you of this in a moment.

I had to open it up. Right,

if you remember this training, we had our different stages.

You know, unaware,

problem aware, solution aware, product aware,

most aware. Right? And actually,

I mean, I can look at the output we did. Thank And

by ChatGPT's own sort of admission,

the amount of people, Gemini's own admission,

the amount of people who were product aware was like 10-15%.

They know rental arbitrage is a strategy, coaching programs for it exists,

right? Uhm,

so really, maybe like 15-25% of people total know about this.

So if this, if that was your market,

then fine. But like we talked about,

we're probably really more up here in this sort of problem aware space

for BizOp, especially if we're trying to go broad.

And so, in this example, at the very least,

I'm trying to go broad. So,

this is talking about, hey, you've been thinking about all wrong that's too far

along in the journey,

the mental journey of where your prospect is at,

if we're going for a broader market,

okay? So, I'm actually just going to go ahead and skip this.

Like, it does tell you what I like, here's how it's connected to the

brief, that's cool. but it's just not meeting

us where we need to be, okay? Idea number two,

the cash flow oasis method. Unique mechanism of the problem,

the real reason you're stuck. You're looking for opportunities in the wrong place. Every

other course in Guru points you to the red oceans,

the obvious oversaturated downtown cores,

and prime vacation spots. This is where competition is fierce,

landlords are skeptical, and profits are shrinking.

You're fighting for scraps with hundreds of other people who heard the same bad

advice. Unique mechanism of the solution.

We've developed the cash flow oasis method, a proprietary data-driven process for identifying

untapped markets. These are overlooked neighborhoods and property types with high short-term rental demand

but virtually zero competition. We teach you how to analyze specific zoning laws,

local event schedules, and corporate housing needs to find these hidden gems.

Instead of fighting for a condo downtown, you'll be placing a property next to

a regional hospital that needs housing for traveling nurses,

Creating a non-stop stream of revenue. You don't need to be the best,

you just need to be the only one in the right place.

So, why is it connected to the brief? The research brief.

It directly addresses the objection that everyone is doing this now and it won't

work anymore, counters past failures of other business models like dropshipping due to oversaturated

markets, appeals to the desire for smart money moves and a system that eliminates

guesswork, Go to Beadaholique all of beading supply Speaks to the burnout professional and

FIRE adherent who appreciate a systematic, data-driven approach.

So if I evaluate this mechanism, it still

has the same problem,

ultimately, as what we just said with mechanism number one,

which was that the Proud of Market awareness

level is pretty high. Where my mind goes,

and this is where things get nuanced, is could you still make this work?

Yeah. You theoretically,

I mean, you can make anything work, kind of, right?

Not anything, but a lot of things. Because it's like,

the rest of my copy, and if you're more advanced, you might be thinking

this too, and if you're not, that's not a knock on you,

it's just like an experience in itself. Right? Uhm,

like, you could speak to, like, someone who is problem aware,

and doesn't know what to do with Airbnbs, but not,

like, just buying short-term rentals, you know,

some people call it Airbnb arbitrage, whatever,

blah, blah, blah, okay, so here's the thing,

like, right? Like, you've probably heard of Airbnb hosting,

like, because there are a lot of people who are solution aware,

maybe even thought about getting it, but, like, there's a couple problems,

right? One of the problems is the saturation,

and this is how you address that. So, like, this could be part of

it, but it still wouldn't necessarily get into,

like, the, me in the market,

where they're at if we're trying to do people who are sort of problem

aware, right? Idea

number three, the automated hospitality engine.

This mechanism tackles the fear of creating another time-consuming job,

a major pain point for the target audience. Unique mechanism of the problem,

the reason you're stuck. Every side hustle you tried has failed for one reason,

it wasn't a business, it was just another job. You traded your nine-to-five for

a 24-7 hustle that demanded all your time and energy,

leading to burnout. You're stuck in the active hustler trap,

believing that more income will must equal more work.

Unique mechanism of the solution, how do we solve it? We don't teach you

how to run a rental, we teach you how to build an automated hospitality

engine. I really like this name, by the way,

it's actually quite good. This is a complete system of software processes and virtual

team members that handles 95% of operations for you.

From guest communication and cleaning schedules to pricing optimization and maintenance calls,

the engine runs on autopilot. Your job isn't to answer late-night calls,

but your job is to be the architect of a business that runs itself.

This is the only way to achieve true time and location freedom,

creating passive income and not just another paycheck.

Connection to the brief.

Directly addresses the objection, this will be another overwhelming side hustle that takes over

my life. Fulfills the primary promise of work from anywhere with just a laptop

and build a business that doesn't require 80-hour work weeks.

Appeals directly to the burnout professional and stay-at-home parent seeking flexibility.

Contrasts with the gig economy work they've tried,

which is the definition of training time for money.

Okay, so.

This might seem simple, but if you actually look at a lot of the

BizOp stuff that does well,

you'll, especially with the curse of knowledge almost, you'll be like, wow, that just

seems like that mechanism isn't really that complex,

right? But there's a reason why there's not usually complex

mechanisms in BizOp, and that is actually not because of the market.

Like, it's not about the intelligence level of the market.

It's because of where the market's at on that product awareness

scale we keep talking about, right?

And so this mechanism speaks to them there,

so I like it. So I'm going

to take this one, because I like it, and I'm going to copy and

paste it into that doc, okay? So now we have one of these ideas

that's being copied and pasted in. My daughter came in for a minute,

so I paused it. My oldest daughter.

And by the way, we are going to do,

you know, health-related ones as well, with, like, ingredients and supplements and blah blah

blah. But I want to start with this example first,

okay? So I like that one, I put it into this doc.

So you're basically creating a doc, potential mechanism is dropping it in here,

okay? Let's see, idea number four,

the capital multiplier framework. This mechanism is designed

to shatter the belief that you need a lot of money to get into

real estate. Unique mechanism of the problem,

the real reason you're stuck. You've been priced out of real estate because you're

stuck on the idea of ownership. You believe the ownership only path is through

massive down payments, perfect credit and bank loans,

a game rigged against the average person. This ownership fallacy keeps you on the

sidelines, believing you don't have the capital to even start.

We teach the capital multiplier framework, which focuses on control,

not ownership. This method shows you how to secure your first cashflow and property

with minimal upfront capital under $15,000 by leveraging our negotiation scripts and

creative funding strategies. Then the magic happens.

We show you how to systematically multiply that initial capital by rolling the cashflow

from your first property into acquiring your second,

the cashflow from your first to your third,

and so on. You're not just building one income stream,

you're building a self-funding portfolio that grows exponentially without requiring another dollar from your

own pocket. Okay,

this is what happens when I try to record a video in the evening.

It's like, kids running in, my dog's pawing at me.

So, I don't really know where the f*** I was,

that's great, uhm, but,

So, basically, with a mechanism like this,

My objective,

My projection to it would be,

Okay, show you how to get your first cash flow property with zero minimal

upfront cost. Then I'll show you how to roll that cash flow

into acquiring properties. Uhm,

and so on, right? The

trade-off there, Would

be, you're not really teaching a pure Airbnb arbitrage strategy.

How to start with that, and then actually build up a portfolio of properties

to acquire wealth, right? So,

there's that, right? So, I have that objection,

but it's interesting enough, I'm gonna add it to this document as well.

Okay,

number five. Community due diligence system.

Unique mechanism of the problem. For whatever reason, you're stuck.

You've been burned before. You brought courses from gurus,

sold your dream, and then disappeared. This has created an information-action gap.

You consume information, but you paralyze by fear of making another costumary mistake.

Because you're forced to do it alone. The lone wolf approach is the fastest

path to failure. How do we solve it?

Build on the principle of community due diligence. This isn't just a course,

it's a living, breathing support system. Before you sign a lease or furnish a

property, you submit your plan to the community. A group of experienced operators and

coaches who vet your numbers, your location,

your strategy. This collective intelligence acts as your personal manager.

A brand of advisors protecting you from bad deals and rookie mistakes.

You're not just buying information, you're gaining access to a hive mind that provides

real-time support, accountability, and confidence to finally take action.

We succeed only when you succeed.

This one's not, like, terrible. Like,

it does speak to this idea around people wanting a supportive community.

but it's like very much product

It's also,

like, if you don't have this, like, you'd have to change your entire,

This is all for a hypothetical course, but, like, probably if I don't have

this built out, now I have to build all of this out.

So it's not, like, a bad idea, but I'm not really gonna count it

as, like, a great mechanism. Uhm,

you know, one thing I could do, by the way, is,

You know, say, Great.

I like number three the most.

The reason why is because this one speaks the most

to problem-aware people versus

most of the other Thank you.

Ideas you shared would speak more to product-aware,

right? Uhm, folks is a smaller market segment,

so I'd rather focus more

on problem-aware folks or people than

anyone else. Uh,

with that being said, can you please provide

some more unique mechanism ideas

along the lines of number three?

Okay? So,

let's go ahead and do that. Meanwhile,

I will save this. What

do you know. Put,

uhm, okay.

So I'm going to save that in this document as you're going to see.

I'm just going to do, like, optional follow-on.

I'll do

it

Yeah, I'll put it here. I'll make this bigger for my better view,

right? Thank you. So,

the most. Now,

you could also just do a variant of this that

just

says, I like number three the most, give me more like number three,

right? Alright,

so there's your sort of optional thing. While it's doing

that, thinking about reflecting on it,

let's see if any of these are good.

Alright,

the Cash

Not building permanent assets. This is the fundamental trap that keeps 99% of people

from ever receiving true financial freedom. We don't teach you how to earn more

income, we give you a blueprint to build your first Cash Flow Asset.

An asset is something that puts money in your pocket whether you show up

to work or not. Our blueprint shows you how to create a small,

manageable business that generates predictable monthly cash flow from day one.

This is okay, but it's sort of not really that unique.

I'm

skimming through these mechanisms because I think they're trying to,

it's trying too hard to make them too much like number three.

So, I was curious what would happen with that follow-on prompt,

but I don't really like it that much to be honest with you.

So, let's go over to our friends, Mr.

Deep Research, or Mrs. Deep Research,

or Mrs. Miss, or whatever,

okay? So,

doing this for, it's

the same prompt, right,

the same Airbnb arbitrage prompt, uhm,

but we had Deep Research enabled in

this case, right? So,

it's gonna give you a lot more like. Background,

yadda, yadda, yadda. What you'll find is just like before,

we can come down here and get a summary of the mechanisms,

right? Uhm, but let's kinda just read through these ones a little bit so

we can see, okay? Section 1,

the foundational premise, escaping the side hustle sandbox.

The modern aspiring entrepreneur is caught in a debilitating cycle,

driven by a potent combination of financial frustration and a deep desire for autonomy,

they seek an escape from what they perceive as a rigged economic system.

Their journey, however, almost invariably leads them into a strategically compromised environment,

the side hustle sandbox. This report posits that the consistent failure of the target

prospect is not a reflection of their effort, intelligence,

or ambition, but a direct consequence of operating within this flawed ecosystem.

Understanding and articulating the nature of the sandbox is the foundational step in reframing

their problem and presenting rental arbitrage as a genuine vehicle for wealth creation,

rather than just another fleeting opportunity. The problem with hustles and the nature of

the sandbox. An analysis of the prospect's past attempts reveals a clear pattern.

They've experimented with a portfolio of common side hustles,

drop shipping, affiliate marketing, multi-level marketing,

freelancing, and various forms of gig economy work.

While marketed as accessible paths to entrepreneurship,

these ventures share a fatal structural flaw.

They are not true businesses, but rather low-value leveraged activities.

In each case, the individual acts as a disposable,

replaceable cog within a much larger platform or system they do not control.

The drop shipper is beholden to Amazon. Amazon's or Shopify's algorithm and

policies, the affiliate marketer is dependent on the commission structure of other companies.

The gig worker for Uber or DoorDash has no ownership of the platform,

the customer relationship, or the economic terms of their labor.

This environment is a sandbox. The side hustle sandbox is characterized by its alluringly

low barrier to entry, often requiring a little capital,

and promising a quick start. This accessibility is precisely what makes it a trap.

The sandbox is an arena of hyper-saturation,

unstable income, and intense competition, where the individual possesses no defensible competitive advantage

or moat. The result is a predictable cycle of initial excitement,

followed by diminishing returns, financial loss, and disillusionment.

This directly accounts for the prospect's history of having wasted money.

They've been diligently playing a game that is, by its very design,

unwinnable for the vast majority of participants.

Entrepreneurial Trauma and the Allure of the Family Failure Trap The

repeated failures within the sandbox environment inflict more than just financial damage,

they create a distinct form of entrepreneurial trauma.

This trauma manifests as the deep skepticism of gurus and get-rich-schemes that defines

the prospect's worldview. Having been burned before,

they are now hyper-vigilant and cynical, however, a paradoxical and counter-intuitive psychological dynamic emerges

from this trauma. While they are skeptical, their fear of further financial loss makes

them subconsciously risk-averse in a way that perpetrates their failure.

The chain of events is as follows. This prospect,

feeling trapped by stagnant wages and rising costs,

seeks an escape route. They are drawn to the most visible and seemingly accessible

options, the side hustles promoted across social media.

These ventures inevitably fail,

reinforcing their belief that building a business is fraught with

peril and leading to significant financial and emotional costs.

This experience creates a deep-seated fear of risk,

encapsulated by the objection, the real cost will be way higher than advertised and

I'll lose money like I had before. When they summon the courage to look

for their next opportunity, this profound fear of loss subconsciously guides their decision-making.

They shy away from anything that appears too complex, requires significant capital,

or seems too real, as these factors are perceived as indicators of higher risk.

Consequently, they retreat to the perceived safety of another low-cost,

simple-to-start venture. In other words, they re-enter the very sandbox that guarantees their failure.

The core marketing challenge, therefore, is not merely to present a new opportunity,

but to break this psychological feedback loop. The messaging must demonstrate that the real

risk-alertness of buys and remaining a player in the sandbox and that true financial

safety is only found by graduating to a real asset-backed business model.

The core dichotomy, activity vs. assets.

To break this cycle, a new fundamental distinction must be introduced.

I know this is very formal, but I think it's amazing.

Side note, I actually think it's incredible, but I know it's very formal-seeming,

so we'll, you know, don't stress that too much.

Fundamental distinction must be introduced

in the prospect's thinking, the difference between activity and assets.

All of their past failures, driven from, driving for a ride share company,

posting affiliate links, running ads for dropshipping products were based on activity.

They were paid only for the actions they performed,

and the moment the activity stopped, the income ceased.

This is the hamster wheel of the sandbox. Rental Arbitrage,

if framed correctly, represents the first accessible pathway to controlling a cash flowing asset.

Without the traditionally prohibited barriers to entry,

such as massive down payment or a perfect credit score.

This reframes the entire endeavor. It is not another hustle,

it is a strategic move to transition from a hustler,

who perpetually trades time for money, into an investor or operator,

who generates revenue from a single, from a system built around a tangible asset.

This is the exit ramp from the sandbox. The coaching program,

therefore, is not selling information about a better side hustle,

it is providing the keys to a new vehicle designed for an entirely different

designation, destination, systemic wealth creation through asset control.

Okay, section two, economic and systemic mechanisms,

reframing the rigged game. The target market is acutely aware of their precarious financial

position, they feel trapped in a rigged economic system,

where traditional paths to prosperity, such as loyal employment and diligent saving,

no longer seem to deliver on their promises. To resonate with this deeply felt

frustration, the unique mechanisms must diagnose their problem at a macroeconomic

level. This approach validates their feelings about the system being broken while presenting rental

arbitrage not as a simple trick, but as a sophisticated and logical strategic response.

By reframing the struggle in systemic terms,

the program can position itself as an essential tool for navigating the realities of

the new economy. Mechanism 2.1,

the asset gap and privacy in Concordia. The unique mechanism of the problem.

You've been trying to solve an asset gap problem with an income gap solution.

This is f****** great. This is so good. Side note, um,

pardon my language, I just hit my headset and it started playing music,

so that's super duper. Um,

this is so good, because it's like meeting them,

where they're at,

right? People who are problem aware and slightly product aware

and that they've tried side hustles, like a really high percentage of people are

now doing that. In fact, I just saw, and I'll share this with you

today, this goes back to the importance,

of staying curious Americans are silent hustling

like we're in a recession. The two job trend these days is about assessing

that, uh, pursuing a passion. There's a whole article just about how many Americans

have a side hustle, right? So even if they're not aware of like Airbnb

arbitrage, coaching, whatever, they're aware of side hustles.

And most, many of them are participating in those.

So this is a pretty easy,

like reframe, right? It's like, Hey, you've been thinking about the problem the wrong

way. It's like a paradigm shift. It's really good.

Um,

the prospect correctly identifies the symptom, the squeeze of stagnant wages against the rising

cost of living. Their logical yet flawed conclusion is that they simply need to

make more money. This leads them down the path of side hustles,

which are fundamentally income gap solutions.

These hustles may provide a temporary marginal increase in monthly earnings,

but they do nothing to address the core underlying disease.

The rigged game is not merely about the size of one's paycheck,

it's about the structural divide between those who build wealth through appreciating cash-flowing assets

and those who are confined to earning active income.

Their past failures in dropshipping, freelance, and gig work were preordained because these activities

never allowed them to cross the chasm from the world of labor to the

world of assets. They are merely patching a leaking boat instead of building a

new one. The unique mechanism of the solution.

The program teaches the asset control method,

the first system that allows you to leapfrog the income gap and directly address

the asset gap. Rental arbitrage, through this lens,

is presented as a paradigm shift. It's what I said earlier.

It's the first viable strategy for the capital-constrained individual to gain control over

a highly-valued cash-flowing asset, a residential property,

without needing hundreds or thousands of dollars in capital or the pristine credit required

for traditional ownership. By leasing a property long-term and operating it as a short-term

rental, the prospect fundamentally alters their position in the economic hierarchy,

which speaks to their status and dreams and all this stuff.

They stop being a seller on their own time and become an operator of

an asset. This mechanism transforms the program from a how-to guide into a strategic

blueprint for changing one's fundamental economic identity.

It directly delimits the livers on the promise of building wealth through real estate

without the need for mortgages or large payments.

So as you may have guessed from me talking through this,

I love this one. So guess what?

It goes in my document. I'm going to do little dividers here for this

one. Do it here and Okay,

well wait, there's more, as you can imagine.

Alright, the Capital Efficiency Threshold,

UMP. Every business model has a capital efficiency threshold,

a point where the capital and effort invested generate a meaningful level of life-altering

return. Your past attempts failed because they operated below this threshold.

The prospect's history is a story of capital inefficiency.

Low-cost DIY courses, while cheap,

provide information without leverage, yielding near-zero ROI.

Side hustles demand countless hours for profits that are too small to meaningfully change

their financial situation. At the other end of the spectrum,

traditional real estate investment has a capital efficiency threshold that is prohibitively high,

requiring a down-payment and closing costs that are simply out of reach.

The prospect has been trapped in a no-man's-land of capital inefficiency,

a frustrating zone where their time, energy, and limited funds are consumed by ventures

that are structurally incapable of reaching critical mass or generating escape velocity.

Unique mechanism of solution.

Rental arbitrage, executed through the program's profit multiplier system,

is engineered to be the most capital-efficient model for the modern entrepreneur operating in

the sweet spot of the investment spectrum. This mechanism,

positions the program's methodology as a feat of strategic engineering.

It is designed to occupy a unique and powerful niche.

It sits far above the noise and low returns of the side hustle sandbox

but remains comfortably below the impossible capital barrier of traditional property ownership.

The system specifically teaches you how to deploy a relatively modest amount of capital,

under $15,000 for example, to gain control of an asset worth hundreds of thousands

of dollars. This active leverage allows the prospect to immediately I'll see you next

Cross the capital efficiency threshold and begin generating significant monthly cash flow

from day one, a feat that no other model they have tried can realistically

offer. Okay, so I like that

mechanism too.

Let's go ahead and save it.

So now

Alright. So now it talks about FIRE.

fire but as an accelerant for it. This program becomes the turbocharger for their

fire journey. This messaging co-ops the immense credibility and desirability of the FIRE movement

while simultaneously solving a single greatest perceived flaw at its agonizingly slow pace.

UMP becomes your desire for financial independence is correct,

but the traditional FIRE path is a 30-year marathon you don't have the patience

for. DMS becomes our system allows you to generate significant cash flow now,

which you can then use to supercharge your long-term investments.

Instead of saving a few hundred dollars from your paycheck, imagine filling thousands.

Funneling thousands of monthly profit into your index funds.

This for me allows the prospect to achieve FIRE on your terms,

on your timeline, resolving the internal conflict and positioning the program as a pragmatic

bridge between their urgent desires and their long-term goals.

So even though this didn't have a sexy subheader, this was another unique mechanism,

right? This one is cool. I actually do like the idea.

The problem here would be that it's too niche.

So go back to the levels of awareness.

I don't know where I had it last, but basically, if we go back

to the levels of awareness, that's like a hyper-aware,

like very solution-aware kind of segment of the market,

right? So while it's good,

it is unfortunately going to just be too niche for us,

so I'm not going to put that on my document because of the levels

of awareness, right? Because anyone who doesn't want to know what FIRE is,

which some of you watching don't, are not,

doesn't appeal to you. It's too far down in the awareness scale,

right? Okay,

Section 3, Psychological and Behavioral Mechanisms,

Deconstructing the Guru-Induced Decision Deficit.

Uhm.

This

one I'm going to skim through, because the Guru-Induced Decision Deficit,

right, uhm,

is also going to be speaking to someone who's too highly aware of,

like, gurus and the guru model. So it might be good,

if you are speaking to that segment, which people do speak to,

especially early on, like we talked about this,

uhm. A lot of people get to,

like, 1 million, 2 million, 3 million, you know,

a year, by speaking to people way further than that.

Like, by speaking to people in here,

right? The problem is, to get to 10 million,

20 million, 30 million, 50 million, you're going to speak to people up here.

And I know,

by the way, I guess it's like, lots of people watching this are copywriters,

so it's like, keep in mind, when you get hired to write stuff,

and if you want to be consultative,

and help a business to expand and grow,

this is, like, an incredible way you can help to do that,

by doing initiatives that change who you're speaking to and where you're

at on this, right?

Uhm, Or, if you're going to write something new,

keeping this in mind is really important, right?

So, hopefully you can see that. For a business owner,

I would hope that this is pretty obvious,

okay? So, I'm just going to go through that one. Okay,

Mechanism 3.2. The Implementation Chasm of DIY Learning.

The unique mechanism of the problem, you have consistently failed because you keep trying

to cross the implementation chasm alone. The prospect consumes vast quantities of free or

low-cost information. From YouTube, blogs, and cheap DIY courses,

they accumulate fragments of knowledge, how to listen on Airbnb,

what to say to a landlord, etc. However, there exists a vast and treacherous

chasm between knowing what to do in theory and doing it in practice when

real money, legal agreements, and unforeseen problems are on the line.

This chasm is where fear, uncertainty, and complexity reside.

It is the moment a landlord asks a question not covered in the script

or when a guest has an emergency at 3 a.m. Without a support structure

to bridge the gap, the prospect consumes and stands on the edge, overwhelmed and

isolated, and eventually their motivation erodes and they retreat.

Information alone is tragically insufficient.

Uhm.

So this is sort of like guided implementation. This is good.

I'm not going to read all of it because, again,

I think we're too far along in awareness. And by the way, I probably

could have modified this prompt. Like,

another thing I would actually experiment with is doing the same prompt.

The unified thing and also including the public market awareness breakdown saying,

focus on this segment, right?

Utilizing landlord objections, kind of the same issue there,

right? Uhm.

Another liability, like a landlord thing,

so probably too advanced for what we're looking for.

There's even more, okay? This one's gonna be about

franchising a box.

This is where some knowledge on the market can be helpful.

Teaching a franchise management strategy.

Franchise model is not a bad thing. I do wonder if,

Basically what this is saying is, hey,

trying to do it on your own with YouTube, whatever it is,

is not like, uhm, like, uh, you know, doesn't make sense.

You know, you should follow a franchise model. People do this in real estate

a lot. It does work. It could work in Airbnb too,

right? Uhm, you know, with we

basically are like a franchisable system, right? We're efficient,

all that. I'm gonna copy and paste it into my doc,

even though I wouldn't personally select this one, uhm,

because it doesn't really speak to, uh,

it could be used for a broad,

you know, segment of the market, right? Uhm,

basically people who are like problem aware.

Could be used.

The automation stack that buys you time.

Okay, your ultimate vision is passive income,

but your past experiences with side hustles have only created more active burdens.

Your right to fear that rental arbitrage could become a high maintenance 24-7 job

because without the proper infrastructure. Here it is. The core fear is a bait

and switch. The promise of freedom leading to the reality of endless work.

A short-term rental business managed manually is incredibly demanding.

It involves constant guest inquiries, booking management,

price adjustments, cleaning coordination, and handling of unexpected issues at all hours.

The prospect's fear is not irrational. It is a logical conclusion based on an

incomplete understanding of how a modern house value business can be run.

UMS, we do not teach you the arbitrage model. We teach you how to

build it. It truly hands off business using a proprietary automation stack.

Essentially, we're going to automate all this stuff for you,

so it's going to be easy, okay? They have a summary,

talking about implementation stuff. I do appreciate that

it says, you know, for problem-aware prospects, for solution-aware prospects,

which ones it likes. Uhm,

I just recommend this as one of the ones which I

agree with. It does put this all into a little,

uhm, a summary,

and I guess it does have, you know, your little side hustle sandbox here,

uhm,

which I did like, and it didn't frame that in,

like, a mechanism term exactly, but,

probably,

it has,

like, the sandbox, I don't know if we need to give it that context.

I like the concept. I'm not sure what to do with it.

Like, it doesn't, the unique mechanism solution is a little weak,

right? Because you're like, yeah, this is true.

This is like a good hook or like a big idea potentially,

which we'll talk about another module, but it's not really like,

it's like, it's not really as,

uh, tangible of like, this is why,

like, it makes sense. This is why you failed, you know,

like that part made sense. So this is why it'll be different.

This is sort of just like, oh, we're gonna help you through it, right?

So you can combine in theory, this with the stuff around the income asset

gap or whatever it is right now,

fairly quickly. I would do two things.

I'm going to run this prompt again.

And have it tell it to focus specifically on people who are problem aware.

So I'll do that. So I'll do that now, basically.

Let's

do a new chat, okay? Blah,

blah, blah. Okay, I finished it. I

don't think I'll go over all the outputs in this video,

because I think you get the idea. But,

where would I change it? I'm

gonna say, for this exercise,

let's specifically focus on people in the

market who are problem aware.

Let's go ahead and get started. Deep research.

One moment. Okay, upload that.

We'll let it go. I do want to show you real quickly,

I did a chat GPT, deep research,

asked me some questions, like it always does,

but, Basically,

all the chat GPT ones were sort of too basic.

There's sort of, Just cute nicknames for really basic stuff,

like, The Asset Ownership Trap,

you know, you've been told you don't own properties, but you can arbitrage it.

It's like, okay, you know what I mean? Like, uhm, The

Landlord Permission Thingy-propaganda, right? The Guru Trap.

Uhm, you know, you chase easy money,

but gurus suck, like, it just was not,

Nothing here.

There's cool names, like it's, you know, you can always go through it.

But, it wasn't strong enough. And I tried Claude's Deep Research,

which I had never used before to be honest with you, I was just

curious. Uhm,

It was sort of the same idea of, like, Like,

this idea right here about controlling versus owning is kind of interesting.

Uhm...

But most of what it had was sort of like the Anti-Guru Arbitrage Authority,

it's like, okay, it's just a bunch of cute nicknames that aren't actually that

substantial, right? And so that's why,

uh, I'm not going to spend a ton of time on them.

I think Gemini is going to be the best outputs for this section as

well, okay? So,

I do, you know, want to see what I get from Gemini.

Oh my gosh, what do I need to do? Do I need to, like,

say, start research? That's what I'm most into.

But in the meantime, I mean,

I hate, This is part of me that I hate to,

This might take a few more minutes and I don't know that I want

to wait for it to come out. Eh, I won't.

Give me a minute. You know,

actually, I think, like, again, as much as I would be cool to see

more mechanisms, I'll share these with you and maybe we can go over them

in a subsequent video. But I want to show you another

prompt we can do, okay? So now we've got these ideas.

I'm going to show you prompt number four.

You know what I'm doing? I'll do some new video and that way I'll

have the additional mechanisms for Airbnb. And then we'll also have a video for

skincare. We'll do one for maybe another supplement.

We'll do some stuff for golf, whatever it is. But let me show you

the general idea for this one, right? After we have our mechanism ideas,

we're going to be like, hey, I'm working on some direct response sales copy

that will sell a product to niche. I'm going to share a few documents

with you. The first is a really unified research document.

The second has a bunch of unique mechanisms. Reminder of what a unique mechanism

is. Here's what I want you to do,

evaluate each mechanism based on their potential for connecting to our target market and

persuade them to buy the product we are selling,

rank the most likely to succeed, the least likely to succeed.

Um, you know, utilize these things.

So let me actually, instead of trying to kind of rush through this one,

I'm feeling a little fatigued. Let's pause here and then I'll start up in

the next video with this prompt.

Um, continuing on with Airbnb arbitrage.

And I'll explain the value of this as well.

Uh, I mean,

yeah, I'll just save what I'm going to save for the next video I

do on this. Um, I'm trying to think here

if I want to add anything to it. No, I think that's good.

And then, yeah, I can still do other examples and there's a lot We'll

see you next time. Um,

hopefully you see like, you know, how cool this kind of is though.

Um, how you can get a lot of mechanism ideas and most importantly,

how they're, you know, matched like to that

product market awareness level and keeping that in mind.

I think I might even revise this prompt a little bit to further.

Hone in on the specific market

segment I want to do. I might even mess with the process a bit

more in the meantime and I'll update for another video if I do that

too. Alright, we'll stop here for this one. Thank you.
