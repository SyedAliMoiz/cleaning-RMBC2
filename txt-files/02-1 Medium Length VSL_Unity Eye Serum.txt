Alright, so now let's look at doing a medium length VSL.

So it's gonna be like between 6 and 16 minutes. We kind of started

looking at this with Unity before. Um,

I uploaded the brief, so let's make an 18 minute VSL.

And I started writing this one, right? This one,

if you remember,

we looked

at this in

the brief, like I said, I had like the three phases of, like, aging

eyes. So it was like phase one was crazy.

Pros feet, dark circles, phase three,

losing elasticity. If

you

look at the structure of this, I know I'm just skimming through it.

I think this is pretty good. If I, honestly, what I want to see

here, I'm gonna save this one, cause frankly it was good.

I mean, you need a better lead, but like,

I don't know that it's worth just reading through the whole thing again.

But I'll just show you what I'm thinking. I feel like I gave you

the keys to the kingdom of how to create these, right? Uhm,

what I want to do,

there's a couple things here. First of all, I'm gonna do, like, UnityIsurum, and

copy and paste this one, right? So,

this was pretty soft, right? Again, like, I actually think it was good.

I know we can't go through all of it.

I actually really like it.

The one thing I want to do, is I want to see one that

comes from an anti-aging expert or doctor,

right? Okay, so.

What I'll do here,

let me save this to, I think it's in

here, right? Nope,

it's the old

Give me a second to save this to the right place. Alright,

so that's good. Right,

so I'm gonna upload a cumbersome brief, write it,

give me an outline. So watch this,

okay? As you recall,

the brief, which by the way, in this version of the brief, if you

watched the long-form one, I did add in those,

um, missing ingredients here, right? So I put those in. So I'm gonna say,

like, uhm, I think I'm gonna write it. One

important note, I want this,

so, version to actually not come from Laura.

Let's instead have it come from Dr.

Blaine Schilling. So we'll want to discuss,

or discuss, we'll want to change the spokesperson.

And the background story.

Let's just have it be that Dr.

Schilling is an expert.

He had woman came

into his practice complaining,

uh,

so. Wait

a second. Let's

say a woman. Medical

practice and said something he'd never heard before.

She said she wasn't there

because she felt tired or old.

She actually felt young and full

of life inside. She was there because her skin,

especially the area around her eyes,

uh,

didn't match up with how she felt.

She looked tired and old,

even though she still felt the prime of her life,

wise, confident, empowered,

uhm, actually confident.

She...feel old.

Dr. Schilling was surprised by this.

A dermatologist. He was a,

anti-aging doctor,

but he wanted to help,

so he promised,

to do some research for the lady.

What he covered changed everything.

Think

you think you know about,

Skincare, uh,

skincare, uh, wrinkles, problems, etc.

Cool angle, I think,

because it can talk about how able

to find the truth. Because he was coming at

the problem from an outsider's perspective.

So I'm kinda, I can modify the actual brief on the brief level,

but I can also just sort of do it here, right? Uhm,

so let's see how this goes if I just do it here. Oh f***,

I didn't upload the brief though, so I probably need to do that.

So, my bad. No you haven't.

Shit. So annoying.

I gotta do this again here. Did I download the medium?

Here it is, okay. Alright,

now let's see the outline. Okay.

It is brilliant. I'm

not a dermatologist and that's exactly why I was able to discover what the

entire skincare industry has been getting wrong about eye aging.

Which has everything you need to know about why eye creams have failed you,

you know, the unusual patient visit.

I think in this case I might give it the classic structure again.

I'm gonna say, really good overall,

uploaded my classic sales

letter outline while we were might not be able to go super

in-depth every aspect of

this. I think it helps. Uh,

can I see another version outline that incorporates

things that you think should be added or changed.

Changed based on this, on the

document Cause I don't

want to follow the, I don't want to be in the exact same structure

as the last one. I really liked,

uhm, what I had before. I'm

not sure why Morocco won and Morocco never get crow's feet,

but we'll see.

Okay, let's see. Let's go

ahead and write it. Okay,

now it's gonna write this. Why am I doing it this way?

I know, I'm like, ah! But I'm like,

you know, I gotta remember to explain while I'm recording, right?

The reason I'm doing it this way is because,

frankly, it probably For

me and my VSL, you could test doing it,

like, from Laura or a spokesperson, you know,

test lots of stuff. But,

we probably want to do more like an expert

bee poncho. Okay,

so, now I'll save this outline,

because I like it. So I'm

going to save it

as,

Maybe, uh, like, maybe iserum.vslv2, outline.

Copy paste it. And why are we going to do that?

Because guess what we can

do.

We can run it again in Gemini if we want. I might not, because

I don't want to get bogged down, frankly,

but might as well have it so you won't do that plus the brief

and explain, hey, it's a little bit different, right?

Let's just start reading. I'm not a dermatologist,

and that's exactly why I was able to discover what the entire skincare industry

has been getting wrong about eye aging for the past 80- past- past 30

years. My name is Dr.

Blaine Schilling, and I'm an anti-aging physician. For three decades,

I've helped thousands of patients slow down the aging process and reclaim their vitality.

Like, do I like reclaim their vitality? Not really,

kind of an AI phrase. But I never expected that a single conversation with

one frustrated patient would lead me to uncover a breakthrough that changes everything we

thought we knew about why your eye turns to fility.

If you're a woman over 35 who feels young and full of life on

the inside, when you look in the mirror, the eye area around your eyes,

or the area around your eyes, tells a completely different story, making you look

tired, aged, and worn out, even when you feel vibrant. The one I'm about

to share with you will change everything. Here's where I discovered that no one

in the beauty industry wants you to know. 97% of eye products on the

market today are targeting the completely wrong causes of eye aging.

That's why they won't work. That's why you've spent hundreds,

maybe even thousands of dollars on eye cream, serums, and treatments that promise the

world, but deliver nothing but disappointment. I'm going to show you the real reason

your eyes have been aging faster than the rest of your face. And more

importantly, I'm going to reveal the breakthrough solution that addresses the actual root cause

for the first time in skincare history. Just a few minutes,

I'll tell you about the patient who said something to me that I'd never

heard in 30 years of medical practice, saying that completely changed how I understood

the aging process around the eyes. I'll reveal what I call collagen architecture breakdown,

the hidden structural damage happening beneath your skin that no eye cream has ever

addressed before. And here's the shocking part, everything the beauty industry has told you

about collagen is backwards. You'll discover why expensive department store eye creams actually make

the problem worse by masking the real issue instead of fixing it.

I'll show you the 30 second test you can do right now to determine

if your skin's foundation can still be saved. And I'll explain why women in

certain parts of Morocco never develop crow's feet and has negative genetics.

Now, I know you're probably thinking, Dr. Shaleen, I've tried everything,

nothing works for me. And that's exactly why this breakthrough is so important.

Thank you. The reason nothing has worked isn't because your skin can't be helped.

It's because every product you've tried has been fighting the wrong battle.

I've seen the clinical studies showing up to 39% wrinkle reduction in just four

weeks. I've witnessed the transformation in my own practice and I've reviewed the pure

and I've reviewed the peer reviewed research that proves this approach works when everything

else fails. Before I reveal exactly what this breakthrough is.

Now you can use it to transform the area around your eyes and you

tell you the story of how I discovered it. Because if it wasn't for

one frustrated patient, I refused to accept that looking tired was just part of

being older. This breakthrough might never have come to light.

As I mentioned, I'm not a dermatologist. I'm an anti-aging physician with over 30

years of experience helping patients slow down the aging process from the inside out.

Focus on hormones, nutrition, cellular health,

the medical foundations of longevity and vitality. So Maria walked into my office six

months ago. I wasn't expecting what she was about to tell me.

Most of my patients come to me because they feel tired, sluggish or older

than their years. They want more energy, better sleep,

sharper mental focus, but Maria was different. She sat down in my office and

said something I'd never heard before. Dr. Schilling,

I don't feel tired or old. I feel full of life. I have more

energy than I've had in years. My mind is sharp. I sleep well.

I exercise regularly. But when I look in the mirror, especially on my eyes,

I don't recognize myself. My face, particularly the eye area,

doesn't match how I feel inside. I look exhausted even when I'm not.

I look older than I feel, and it's affecting everything.

My confidence, my relationships, even my career. I was stunned.

In three days, maybe decades of practice, I never had a patient describe the

problem quite like that. Here is a woman who felt young and vibrant on

the inside, but her outer appearance, specifically around her eyes,

was betraying how she actually felt.

journey through the skincare world. She tried everything. Drugstore eye creams, expensive department store

products, even professional treatments. She spent thousands of dollars and countless hours researching,

trying, and hoping. Nothing worked for more than a few days.

The dermatologist kept telling me it's just part of aging.

The dermatologist kept telling me, she said,

Dr. Schilling, if I feel this good on the inside, why can't my eyesight

match? There's got to be something I'm missing. That's when I made a promise

that it would change both of our lives. I told her I wasn't a

skin expert, And I promised to dive into the medical literature to see if

there was something the skincare industry was missing. What I discovered over the next

several weeks shocked me, and it explains why nothing Maria had tried,

and nothing you've tried, has worked. Here's what I found that no one in

the beauty industry wants you to know. And this is good, however. The real

cause of eye aging isn't what they've been telling you.

It's not simply about collagen loss. It's not about dehydration.

It's not about sun damage or genetics or getting older. The real culprit is

something I call collagen architecture breakdown,

happening at what scientists call the dermal-epidermal junction,

the critical boundary where your skin layers meet. Let me explain this in a

way that will make everything crystal clear. Think of young,

healthy skin like a piece of high-quality fabric with a perfectly tight seam.

Every collagen thread in it is in its proper place,

working together to create smooth, strong, beautiful skin.

The weave is so precise and organized that it can hold its shape,

bounce back when stretched, and maintain its structure year after year.

But here's what really happens as we age, and this is where the skincare

industry has been getting it completely wrong. Those collagen threads don't just disappear.

Something far more devastating occurs. The collagen threads become loose,

tangled, and lose their organized structure. Instead of having that tight,

precise weave, your skin's foundation becomes like fabric that's been stretched and twisted until

the threads are all jumbled together. This breakdown begins at the dermal-epidermal junction and

spreads through what scientists call the collagen matrix. When this organized structure collapses,

it creates gaps and weaknesses in your skin's foundation.

And that's when you start to see the visible signs of what I call

architectural failure. The skin's support network can no longer hold its shape,

causing sagging and wrinkles. Nutrients can't travel efficiently through the disorganized matrix,

so your skin becomes loose, becomes dull and lifeless. Dark circles appear as the

weakened structure allows blood vessels to show through the thin

skin. Fluid accumulates in the gaps where organized structure is once provided natural drainage,

causing puffiness and bags. Most importantly, your skin loses its firm,

useful snap because the underlying architecture can no longer bounce back.

Now here's the shocking part. Every eye cream you've ever tried has been attempting

need to add more threads to broken fabric. The trend.

It's to dump more collagen, more moisturizers, more vitamins onto a foundation that's structurally

compromised. It's like trying to fix a collapsed building by painting the walls.

You're not addressing the structural problem, you're just covering it up temporarily.

This is why 97% of eye products fail, they're fighting the wrong battle entirely.

So once I understood that real problem, that the real problem was architectural breakdown

at the dermal-epidermal junction, the solution became obvious.

We don't need to add more collagen to broken fabric,

we need to restore the organized structure of the weaves itself.

That's why I developed what I call the Structural Renewal System,

a three-step process that addresses collagen architectural breakdown for the first time in skincare

history. Here's how it works. Step one, the Structural Renewal System,

or signal. We use a breakthrough compound called dipalmitoylhydroxypropylene that acts like a master

weaver, sending precise signals to your skin cellular machinery.

It commands your fibroblasts to pull those loose tangled collagen threads taut and reorganize

them back into the proper youthful weave. The clinical studies on this ingredient are

remarkable. In peer-reviewed research, participants saw a 32% reduction in wrinkle depth and

a 14% increase in skin firmness in just 28 days.

But here's what makes it truly revolutionary. It's been modified with palmitic acid,

which allows it to penetrate deep into the dermal-epidermal junction where the architectural damage

exists. Step two, the Targeted Repair Complex.

Once we've signaled the rebuilding process, we provide the exact building blocks your skin

needs to rebuild and reconstruct the organized structure. We use precise amino acids,

proline, glycine, and alanine, which aren't random proteins,

but the specific materials that compromise 23% of collagen structure.

Think of it, think of this as providing the highest quality materials to skilled

craftsmen. Your skin knows exactly what to do with these amino acids.

It uses them to rebuild the organized collagen matrix from the inside out.

Step three, the Integrity Locking System. Finally,

we protect your newly restored structure from future breakdown by using compounds that inhibit

matrix meloproteinase,

the destructive enzymes that destroy collagen architecture.

Clinical research shows this approach can reduce collagen-degrading enzyme activity by up to 33%.

This isn't theory, this is proven science. When you combine these three steps,

you're not just treating the symptoms of eye aging, you're reversing the underlying architectural

breakdown that's causing the problem all along.

For the first time, we have a way to restore the organized, beautiful structure

that makes the skin look firmer, healthier, smooth, and resilient,

and the results speak for themselves. I probably would put maybe some testimonials in

there. Once I understood the science behind architectural renewal,

I had to find a product that actually implemented this breakthrough approach,

so I started searching. I looked at every eye cream,

serum, and treatment on the market, analyzed ingredient lists, reviewed clinical studies,

spoke with formulators, and here's what I discovered.

Not a single product was targeting collagen architecture breakdown at the dermal-epidermal junction.

Every single product was still stuck in the old paradigm, trying to add more

collagen to broken fabric instead of fixing the weave itself.

The high-end department store products, they were just expensive moisturizers with fancy packaging.

The clinical brands, they focused on surface exfoliation or basic hydration.

Even the prescription treatments were missing this mark entirely.

I realized if I was going to help Maria and the thousands of other

women dealing with the same frustration, I was going to have to work with

researchers to create a completely new type of formula. That's why I partnered with

a team of cosmetic chemists who specialize in peptide technology and advanced delivery systems.

Together, we spent months working through the challenges of creating the world's first structural

and mineral system. The first problem was getting therapeutic concentrations of dipalmitol,

hydroxyproline, and a stable formula. Most skincare products contain trace amounts of active ingredients,

just enough to plant the label, but not enough to create real change.

We need clinical strength concentrations. The second challenge was ensuring these powerful ingredients could

actually penetrate to the dermal-epidermal junction, where the architectural damage of the skin Most

skincare ingredients stay on the surface of your skin and never reach the deeper

layers where they're needed. After months of testing and refinement,

we finally achieved the breakthrough. We created the first formula that could deliver therapeutic

concentrations of architectural mineral ingredients directly to the DEJ.

After our testing, it was left to patients by practice, including Maria,

and the results were beyond anything I had expected. Within two weeks,

Maria's skin around her eyes started looking smoother and more refined.

By four weeks, the difference was dramatic. Her crows feet and veins visibly softened,

her under-eye area was brighter and firmer, and for the first time in years,

she said she looked in the mirror and recognized herself again. But Maria wasn't

the only one seeing results. Other patients started asking about her transformation.

Word spread through my practice. Soon,

I had dozens of women asking for access to this breakthrough formula.

That's when I knew we had created something truly revolutionary,

and that's how Unity Eye Revice Serum was born. It was the first eye

treatment designed to reverse collagen architectural breakdown using the structural renewal system.

And that's how you get into this close, right?

I mentioned some of the other ingredients. We've enhanced it.

You know. Department store things suck.

Special laser treatments aren't as bad. Never addressed root cause.

It's different. Only treatment that reverses structural damage.

Here's some testimonials.

A small amount. Here's what you can expect.

Supplies are limited. I mean,

honestly, I'm skimming cause it's.

Frankly, quite good, right? Uhm,

let me see. One little thing.

That. I

might get to the part where it goes, let's see. I'm

saying that for this part. That

sure

is a pedo-artifact, though.

this weird thing, but fine.

So, frankly, besides Vitality,

this is, I think,

really good. I honestly don't really have edits to make to it,

to be honest with you. I would test other little leads in front of

it. But,

let's go.

EMI,

Unity,

Icerum,

VSL number 2.

Okay,

this part.

I gotta see what it wrote, so it's weird that Claude did it that

way, but over here. That

was example 1, let's go to example 1.

That's my partner.

Okay, so I'm just

gonna change this.

So it says,

that's my partner of the team at Opal Beauty.

I mean, again, the patient thing, so I kind of,

see if I can use that with Dr. Schilling, having given it to patients.

We've given it to a lot of people, so I'll have to think about

that part. But overall, really good.

I mean, the only other thing, You

know. And,

you know.

I feel younger. One thing I might like to see in this microlead is,

like, a little promise. So I'm gonna share that feedback,

too. Great.

And then one thing I might like to see at

the end of the microlead is a little promise.

I feel

more confident,

basically, future pace.

I also

have to address some Moroccan thing here, right? I think

you need better than this presentation. I think

this is better. Uhm, you know, like, you know,

the vibrant women usually are. What

I might do, because I like Gemini.

Actually, sorry, I'm doing Poe. Because I might

go here. Here's the start of

another, Another version that comes from

Patrick Schilling, uhm, is there anything you'd change or edit with

Let's just see what they say.

So

some of the audience call out, right?

I

don't think we need to rewrite this opening hook. My

name is Dr. Blaine Schilling. I'm an anti-aging physician. For three decades,

my life's work has been helping my patients reverse the clock in aging.

But I never expected the single emotional conversation with one frustrated patient would

lead me to a breakthrough that changes everything we thought we knew about why

your eye creams are doomed to fail you. So if you're 1 over 35,

who feels young and full of life on the inside,

but when you look in the mirror, you're shocked by the sad appearance of

crow's feet, stubborn dark circles, those crepey loose skin that makes you look tired

and worn down, well, I'm about to show you what will change everything.

Uh, in this brief presentation, I'll give you the key to making your eye

appearance find match how you feel inside. There's a scientific reason why those lines

appear overnight, and the simple method you can use at home to visibly smooth

away years of crow's feet and fine lines, brightening the appearance of dark circles,

restoring your youthful snap. Most importantly, you'll never have,

you'll probably have the power to look in the mirror and see the vibrant,

confident look of a woman you know you are, staring right So I like

that, a little bit. A little bit more, so I'm going to switch the

lead out for this Uhm,

the other quick thing is like,

the Morocco thing wasn't paid off right?

Thank you Have day. More

thing, the fascination,

when in Morocco,

and I misspelled Morocco, sorry if people live in Morocco,

isn't really, is very

different, fascination.

We could use an error

that would create curiosity,

but that does get paid off later in the VSL.

I mean, they're not great. I'll show what I have to do to make

the industry terrified. I mean, this is classic scarcity. It works. It's a little

hype- hype-y, but as much as you might not like it,

it tends to work. So I probably would just do that.

So, with that being done,

it's honestly pretty good. I don't really have a lot I want to change

about it. I can still do the same lead process I've shared in the

long-form VSL. That was the video 4 of the long-form example for the Ice

Rim. Uhm, so not necessarily,

like, yeah, I would come up with different concepts, but you don't need to

see me do this endless times. I think you should just play around with

it, and you'll see it. And,

uh, I think we're good. This is the me and the VSL example for

the Ice Rim. Alright, thanks. Goodbye.
