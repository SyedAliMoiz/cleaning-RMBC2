Hey guys, how's it going?

Max Finn here. Now we are going to cover a lot

of stuff in this module, specifically around how

to create really profitable TikTok ads.

Okay? Now one thing I wanna make just crystal clear

before we dive into all the great stuff in this module is

that yes, while this is going to be specifically kind

of focused, and the examples we're gonna talk through

and stuff are around TikTok,

these are fundamental principles to creating great ads.

And those kind of boundaries between platforms have quickly

and rapidly dissolved

and they're gonna dissolve even faster

in the coming year and years.

So what that means is the strategies we'll talk about today,

the principles, the stuff you should be doing,

the the research steps, the, the, the fundamentals

that you put in place is going to allow you

to not just create better TikTok ads,

but better Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, snap, uh, print,

tv, whatever it might be,

because you understand what gets somebody

to stop, pay attention.

What gets them to actually kind

of flip those switches in their brain to go from cold,

I don't care to red hot, here's my credit card,

let me buy those are, are universal

and those transcend platforms.

So we're gonna cover a lot of great stuff,

but we're gonna dive in right now.

But I wanted to kinda preface this, uh, this series

of videos with that little lesson, little tidbit here.

'cause you might be watching this and be like, well,

I'm not running TikTok ads right now.

No big deal, right? Still go through this module

because you're gonna pick up a lot of stuff in here.

It's gonna make your Facebook ads, your YouTube ads.

Where else? Running ads a lot more profitable.

So let's dive in.
