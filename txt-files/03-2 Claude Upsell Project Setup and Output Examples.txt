Alright, so I was recording this and I, uh,

paused it and didn't unpause it. I didn't realize that.

So what we're going to do is we're going to create a cloud project,

right? Same thing we did for VSLs, this one's going to be for upsells.

So your job is to generate upsell video scripts.

They'll typically be between 6 and 16 minutes in length.

The documents in your knowledge base include transcripts for several upsell videos,

which we can model off of already new upsells.

What you'll want to do is analyze the structure of the various upsell examples.

And then synthesize that knowledge and use that same knowledge along with your judgment

to produce new upsells, right? I'll give you details,

write it. Then I included five swipes.

I included Emma upsell we looked at,

SignUpsell. This is based off an upsell that I wrote for

a client that was really good. I basically just told Gemini, hey, create for

a new product in a different niche, so it's like a gut thing.

I'm going to stop right here. It's a good product.

It's really good upsell, great format.

And then StemCellRestore, just because what the hell,

even though it's a cross-sell, so worth including that,

even though, uh, you know, copies,

kind of aggressive, forgive me, wrote it a long time ago before I might

more ethical come to Jesus on stuff. I mean, it's not like terrible,

it's a good product, but whatever. Um, okay. So then,

create the cloud project, which I'll show you here.

Right, literally just put the instructions in here, copy and pasted them here and

here, upload those five PDFs. So the first thing I did,

I said, hey, do a 10-minute upsell script for someone who just bought UDI

Serum, selling them more of the same. And I just linked UDI Serum,

the landing page, and they wrote, like, a script.

It's pretty solid. So, great.

Okay. Obviously, you can give a little feedback, you could tweak it,

you know, all that, like we talked about. Same thing with VSLs,

right? Um, because I'm really focused here on video scripts since,

you know, short ones. Like, you could take,

like, the upsell copy from Happy Mammoth or from the Dr.

Clean or whatever the guy, the Dr. Clean thing is,

and, uh, do short ones and have a project that does that,

too. You need to be empowered at this point in RBC2 to be able

to create your new projects based on what you're looking for, right?

I'm like, cool, we'll now create an AMIC cross-sell script for Lumessa as upsell

2, um, here's All right,

cool, let's see.

Wait, before you go, I have one more breakthrough that could multiply your Unity

Iceworm results by 300%. It's,

name again, I'm obviously thrilled that you just secured your Unity Iceworm six-month age-reversal

system. We shouldn't be assuming that they did that,

right? Like, uhm,

you may too, but like, yeah, I'm going to tell it real quick here.

We shouldn't assume they bought,

uhm, the first upsell.

People will

see this second upsell regardless of if they bought they took

number one or not. So we will feedback real quick so you

can see great feedback. You're right. Oh, that was a big oversight.

Hey, it's him

again.

You made an incredibly smart decision.

It's going to transform how you look and feel, but before we process your

complete order, there's more Breakthrough I need to tell you about,

something that could take your UDI servers away. It's from impressive to absolutely mind-blowing.

You see what UDI is specifically designed to target the delicate eye area.

What most people don't realize is that your eyes are just one part of

your face. I mean, I think most people realize that.

Uh, and if you want to look truly youthful and radiant,

you need to address aging on your entire face with the same level of

precision and power. Here's what I mean.

Okay, so I would edit some of this copy. Uhm,

also what you could do, is be like,

here's like the unified research

doc about the demo. This doesn't change anything,

right? Six months from now,

your eye area looks absolutely stunning. You can see your eye serum,

your crows feet have virtually disappeared. Your dark circles are gone.

Your eyes look bright, youthful, and vibrant. What about the rest of your face?

What about those fine lines around your mouth? What about the rough, uneven texture

around your cheeks? What about the dullness and lack of firmness in your jawline

or forehead? Having beautiful eyes with aged looking skin everywhere else can actually make

you look older, not younger. It's like having a perfectly restored vintage car with

brand new headlights but a rusted, dented body. So

again, there's things I would tweak about this.

I don't know if I'd be so negative.

For a direct response, it kind of makes sense. But I don't know if

I would, I would, uh.

Maybe modify that. But overall,

it's good. You should have some judgment by this point of RBC2 to be

able to modify it. So,

I want to show you another example of this, right? Uhm.

Let's do. Okay,

we have our, uh, Airbnb arbitrage

brief. Let's

do an arbitrage. Alright,

here's information for a product we sell as

a front end. Right now we're going to sell it

as the first upsell.

Well, who just took a $27

info product called uh,

permission.

Wait, I can't spell permissionless,

but that's okay. How the hell do you spell it?

What am I, what am I doing wrong? There you go.

Income that teaches people how to 27

ways to generate extra income from

Mac as well. Now we're going to upsell them,

uh,

to book a call to sell

them on this concept and to Book the call.

Let's make the VNC. So script 10 to 15 minutes.

What the hell am I getting wrong? There are two Ms in there.

Oh my God. I'm that, is that really how you spell permissionless?

Am I just an idiot?

Permissionless.

time. Okay. So we did our brief.

Now we're doing this. I just want to show you what that looks like

to you, right? Let's see. You

know

what I should do is I should have to do an outline. So what

are the VSL first? Because it hits Mac here.

I want to congratulate you. What could be making what could be the most

important decision in your entire financial life. By investing in permissionless income today,

you've taken the first step towards breaking free from the financial cage that's been

holding you back. Before we celebrate and use in this page and watch this

entire video, because I want to share with you could be the difference between

making a few extra hundred dollars a month and completely replacing your job income

with the next 18 months. You see while permissionless income gives

you 27 different ways to generate extra cash. It's incredibly important.

I didn't include in that guide. It's not because I wanted to hold back.

It's because I'm about to show you a super powerful, so game-changing that deserves

its own dedicated training. The intro is about why 95% of side hustles fail.

Where everything goes through the income gap, the asset gap is rigged against you,

what if there's another way, you know,

my story. We'll have to see, depending on what the front end was,

if they already shared the story,

you know, you might not do too much of that there. Why

this works. Here's the thing,

I wasn't planning on teaching this, you know, I'm happy with my portfolio,

but all these overpriced courses, I got mad,

so I'm introducing the Asset Accelerator. It's not another course,

it's not PDFs, it's an 8-week coaching program,

here's what we cover. Blah,

blah, uhm.

You can take this opportunity to bridge the gap from income-dependent to asset-rich.

And we open the asset,

sorry, 4 times a year, element to 50 students,

right.

Bye. When I said to book

a call, what I mean is that instead of talking

about the price, you should really

be selling them on booking a call,

talk with Mac, see if it's a Mac and

his team and to get a personalized action

plan that's theirs regardless of whether they're a

good fit or not. So that's little

things to modify. But foundationally the copy is going to be really

good enough that if you use your brain and common sense,

you know, you should be in pretty good shape, right?

And

we'll wait for this to end just so you can see. You

know. Give you a personalized

asset control blueprint

for free. Get coffee personally.

I'm one of my training specialists. Create a customized plan.

Here's what I'll do during this call.

Okay, now it looks good, right? So,

just, again, I'm sure I've said throughout this course already,

but the one thing that's like, frustrating,

is when, people,

I see a copywriter who's used AI and then didn't read it over and

use common sense, right? Because then you're just being lazy. It's It's doing 99%

of the work for you, so just use your brain. In fact,

it's amazing, when people say AI doesn't make you dumb, it should make you

smarter, because it frees you to actually think,

right? So,

there you go, I'll show you this copy of this script so you can

see it as well. But really it's just a cloud project,

you can play around with it, you can do, some other down cells,

cross cells, whatever you want there, uhm,

and I think if you do that, you should be in pretty good shape,

so, gracias,

goodbye.
