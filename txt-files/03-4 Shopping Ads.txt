Hey everybody, David O'Connell here and today we're going to be talking about Google

Shopping Ad campaigns. We are going to talk about what they are,

we're going to talk about where and how they're served,

and we're also going to talk about how to make effective ads.

So, let's get started.

So, as always, we want to start with the context of where will the

ads be shown, who will see the ads,

and what is the ad format. So,

here are the basics. Google Shopping Ads are designed to reach high-intent,

bottom-of-funnel buyers. Where do these ads show?

Well, they can show up in the Google search results,

either on the top, the side, or on the Shopping tab.

They can show up through Google search partner sites,

like AOL, or Ask.com,

and they can also show up on YouTube,

Gmail, Discover,

or on GDN, uh,

and all those placements get served primarily through performance metrics.

Who sees these ads? Uh,

these ads are triggered when Google matches a user search to your product.

So this is not the traditional keyword targeting,

uh, but it does rely heavily on keywords.

And when you write your ads, you're going to want to make sure similar

to what you would do in an SEO strategy,

you're going to want to make sure that the keywords that you ultimately want

to show up for heavily interspersed throughout

your ad copy. And keep in mind most shopping traffic comes from Google.

What is the ad format?

So the ad format is a product listing ad which consists of an image,

a price, and a merchant name. I'm going to show

you some examples of what this looks like. And these

ads are served dynamically based on your product feed.

So basically what happens is your product feed is a large spreadsheet,

and for each product, you're going to have each of these assets,

the image, the price, and the merchant name. And then whenever Google does feels

like they're able to put one of those products in front of the right

customers, they will do so. And they will pick which product from your feed

and who to put it in front of. Important things to keep in mind

here. Only physical products can run on Google.

And your landing page must be explicitly

So if strictly, uh, use a video sales letter,

you're going to have to develop a new page, uh,

for, uh, this is actually the next point I wrote.

Your product price and the option to buy must be front and center to

receive approval, right? So if you run a video sales letter,

you're going to have That's not going to be automatically approved for Google Shopping.

But if you take that video sales letter and you find some ways to

bring your product price and the option to buy and make them front and

center, uh, then you can get the video sales that are approved to run

on Google Shopping. Um,

if you are a service or you're an info product,

uh, Google Shopping may not be the best space for you,

but there is a lot of inventory here. So if you've already maximized all

the other parts of Google with your info product and you want to move

into shopping, uh, one strategy that we've seen be successful.

is to, uh,

create a physical product and start selling a physical product and offer your info

product as the bonus. And then you can bring customers into the same ascension

path in the back end you otherwise would. So,

alright, let's keep going here for a physical products.

Uh, this is example with Ray-Ban,

uh, using Google shopping ads on the right hand side.

So if somebody went to Google search engine and typed in Ray-Ban,

you can see Ray-Ban search ad shows up on the left side.

So, there's people ready to buy, right? And so by using the Google shopping

ads, you can get people to click right into your product and buy immediately

without even having to take them through their website and have your website and

have them find the category, etc.

But most ready people to buy are typically going to respond to the Google

shopping ads. And you can see the formats here, right?

We have the Ray-Ban Meta AI glasses in the top left and the price.

Uh,

same thing in the middle, but it looks like the ones in the middle

or sunglasses and the one on the left. Uh,

and then we can see on the right side,

the Ray-Ban polarized aviators,

uh, for $4,500.

I wonder why those are so expensive. But you get the idea here of

what you're looking at, right? It's basically putting the product,

the description, the name of the description of the product and the price in

front of people who, uh,

you know, have already done some research and are really ready to buy.

Uh, here's what the feed looks like if I just Google sunglasses.

Uh, Google knows that that is a very product-specific keyword.

They know that my intent is to find products,

and so they put the shopping feed in front of me here. And you

can see a bunch of different brands. Uh,

you can see their product images, their name, their prices.

Uh, very much people are going to make a decision here based on how

the product looks and the price.

And, you know, your description can help nudge them in that direction.

Uh, but mostly, you know, this isn't a lot about educating,

it's about product and price. Uh,

and then, from there, I mean, you can see this was the search results

page. And you can see at the top of the page,

right here, uh, there's a button that says shopping.

If you were to go to the shopping section,

then you'll get a whole category of even more sunglasses.

And there is a large volume of traffic that comes into Google Shopping every

day. So if you have a physical product,

you know, it's kind of like trying to get on the shelf at Walmart

or any big retailer.

There's a lot of people here already shopping, they're already buying,

there's a lot of dollars that flow through here. So if you have a

physical product being listed is likely to get you purchases

for people who are looking for what you're selling. Uh,

all right, so some tips on creating effective shopping ads.

Uh, so as I said, the focus is on product and price for these

ads. Uh, and you will use the Google Merchant Center to set these up.

Uh, so you're going to need a Google Merchant Center account.

That's the first thing you'll want to set up before you can create shopping

ads. Uh, and as I said, you will need to submit your landing page

for approval in that process.

Once you're set up, you'll want to optimize product titles for search relevant,

use high-quality product images, price yourself competitively,

use negative keywords, so you can rule out showing your ads to people that

would be completely irrelevant, It's Use promotions and ratings,

uh, so if we go back here and you look at the sunglasses,

see some of these have four or five stars listed beneath them,

and they have a number of ratings,

that will also help boost your performance as well. Uhm,

and that comes directly from third-party reviews for your brand.

Uhm, and then finally,

as always, you want to look at what the competition is doing and differentiate

yourself, right? If you come and look at these sunglasses,

uh, here you can see what everybody else is doing.

Uhm, so you might look here and say,

okay, you know, uh,

I see aviators that range in prices.

A lot of aviators on this page that are on the less expensive side.

It's $11 glasses, $45 glasses. So if you wanted to rent,

differentiate yourself, maybe you come in here with some higher end Ray-Bans,

maybe those $4,500 Ray-Bans, it seems a little extreme,

but you know, $100 or $200 Ray-Ban aviators might be

a great way to differentiate yourself.

Uhm, and you can find some images in here,

too, where, like, the advertiser is differentiating themselves from,

from, uh, the competition through their image,

right? Some of these are putting the glasses on a person,

uh, as opposed to just putting them on a white background.

Uh,

and then finally, this is a really big tip. Combine your

shopping ads with performance max ads to multiply results.

Uh, standard shopping,

the shopping ad format is very powerful,

and I would say it currently,

shopping ads make up, you know,

I don't know, anywhere from about 15 to 20% of the revenue,

uh, from a well-optimized physical

product ad, Google account.

So it has a really meaningful contribution to your

customer acquisition volume, uhm,

but that doesn't always show up in the standard shopping campaigns,

uh, what we've been doing for a while is uploading

the shopping ads into performance max campaigns.

And you can also put into those performance max campaigns,

you know, your, your other ads. You put your search ads in there and

you also put your display ads in there, etc. But a lot of the

inventory that performance max will serve a large portion of that is

shopping. And it's based on Google's predictions

of who's ready to buy. So,

uhm, that's a really big tip. If you include,

if you only run standard shopping, you're gonna get,

good ROAS but very low volume. If you introduce your shopping feed into performance

max ads, that's where you really can,

can see the full,

I think the full potential of what shopping ads can do.

Uh,

and then also some tactics for your shopping feed.

Um,

so I touched on this a little bit. You can test real life photos

versus white background photos. Also test those against colored background

photos. We've taken some product photos and,

uh, just put them on really bright backgrounds,

right? A bright yellow or a bright green or a bright red.

Uh, and when you do something like that,

I mean, you can, you know, just look at the feed. You can imagine

if any one of these had a color background, it's going to jump much

more off the page, get a lot more attention. That gives you an advantage.

Uh,

for your titles, test really simple titles.

Versus keyword rich titles versus product spec details.

Uh, so you might, examples of this might be,

you might say Ray-Ban aviators as opposed to polarized Ray-Ban aviators.

Or you might try to saying best aviators of 2025.

The one in the middle can often work well because now you'll start showing

up like for people that are searching for polarized Ray-Bans.

But there are some situations where, you know,

we see using, uhm,

you know, something like best aviator of 2025.

can drive much higher click-through rates,

uhm, and much more purchases.

And then for descriptions, you want to give marketing-focused descriptions.

And, and then, once you've said the important thing you want to say,

stuff all the relevant keywords in at the end.

Uh, the middle keywords, the more you can get in there,

the better chance you have of showing up for the keywords you want to

show up So,

here's one more ad, uh, on Google Search,

where the, the search trigger was best greens powder of 2025.

And you can see, you know, all types of different greens powders from all

types of different competitors on the right-hand side,

some of these ads are better than others, very different prices,

right? Do you want to go with the athletic greens at $79 or the

live conscious at $38? Um,

so you really have like a sampling of the whole market here,

uh, for this category search keyword.

And then finally, uh, bear in mind when you upload your product

feeds into performance max ads, You're also going to have this opportunity for your

shopping feed to be displayed in YouTube,

Gmail, or across the Google display network.

So here's an example on,

uh, I believe this is on Buzzfeed of a Google

display ad, which is inexpensive. So I've the shopping feed,

um, and here you have individual products,

shows a discount for the products, and if you click on any one of

those individual products, brings you directly to the product detail page for that

product.
