Alright, so let's continue on here and look at the

prompt in more detail and then look at real world examples.

So, the prompt itself, I am writing some sales copy targeted towards the

demo market information.

You'll see examples below for what that looks like.

I'd like your help doing psychographic research.

What are their struggles and pain points? What are their beliefs?

Below is a series of questions I used in the past as part of

my RMBC method for copywriting, where the R stands for research.

This should be a good framework to use while doing research on the demo.

I'd love it if you can even provide quotes from folks in this demo

by looking at comments on social media or in forums,

etc. Basically, we want to hear what they're saying and what they believe.

We want to hear answers in their own words. Here is the list of

questions. And that's the list of questions we just went through,

right? And that's it.

That's the prompt.

Uhm, so we'll do examples. We'll do, uhm, F3. So we'll do the, uh,

iSerum example. Then I'm

going to do a, the Airbnb BizOp arbitrage example. Then I will do a

golf example, because I'm trying to have some, uh, variety. Okay?

So I'm writing some sales copy targeted towards U.S.

women 40 plus who have wrinkles, dark spots, or puffy eyes,

puffy eye bags. I'd like your help doing psychographic research.

What are their

struggles and pain points? What are their beliefs? Here's the questions. Okay?

So I'll show you how we did this. We did it with three different

LLMs. I did it with.

Um,

Gemini, perplexity, and chat TBT.

So let's go through Gemini first. I'll do it,

uh, here. I'll make it even bigger.

I think we can do 200. Let's see. Part one,

the inner world, demographics, psychographics, and core beliefs.

The woman in the mirror, a multidimensional profile.

Who is your customer? The target customer is a U.S.

woman in age 40 and above, a cohort largely composed of Generation X,

typically defined as those between 1965-1980,

and younger baby boomers. This places her in a unique and often demanding life

stage. She is frequently in her peak earning years,

possessing a higher disposal income than younger generations,

yet she remains a pragmatic and discerning steward of her finances,

making key decisions for the entire household budget.

Her life is characterized by independence, resourcefulness,

and a high level of education. A defining characteristic of this demographic is her

role as a member of the sandwiched generation.

She is often caught in the complex and emotionally taxing position of simultaneously raising

her own children while also caring for her aging parents.

This dual responsibility creates immense pressure,

making the quest for a sustainable work-life balance a central priority.

She is not a passive consumer, she is a research-driven,

analytical individual who values quality,

authenticity, and transparency. She is adept with technology,

primarily using established social media platforms like Facebook and Instagram for connection and information

gathering, but she is often wary of and overwhelmed by the constant influx of

new digital tools and trends. This woman's responsibilities extend

far beyond her own needs, positioning her as the de facto chief medical officer

of her household. As she navigates the healthcare system for her children and parents,

she develops a sustainable and sophisticated, albeit informal,

medical and nutritional literacy. Her focus on health and wellness is not merely aesthetic,

it's a core duty she performs for her family. This elevated role means that

when she researches an ingredient for her own skin, she is implicitly evaluating its

safety and efficacy through the lens of a family protector.

She is not just buying a face cream, she is managing a complex ecosystem

of family well-being. This identity as a savvy,

informed guardian makes her highly receptive to credible science backed information and deeply skeptical

of anything that feels like a gimmick. Marketing that acknowledges and respects this expert

role will resonate far more deeply than messaging that treats her as a simple,

vanity-driven consumer. What attitudes do they have?

Okay? Social and economic.

She is highly research-driven, a highly research-driven consumer,

less swayed by flashy marketing and more influenced by peer recommendations,

detailed reviews and demonstrable results. She is technologically proficient,

using social media to connect, uhm,

but maintains a critical distance, preferring platforms like Facebook and Instagram,

where she has established networks. Her focus on health and wellness has matured.

It is no longer just about looking good, but about feeling good and ensuring

long-term vitality. Economically,

she is stable but cautious, valuing quality and durability and showing a preference for

brands that align with her ethical priorities,

such as sustainability and transparency. Political and religious attitudes,

uh, while the available data does not specify political or religious attitudes,

her core- her affiliations- her core values provide clues to her broader worldview.

Her emphasis on authenticity, ethical practices,

and social responsibility suggests an inclination towards conscious consumerism.

But she also has this profound skepticism of large institutions,

be it the medical establishment or major corporations,

which may align with a more independent, anti-establishment,

or critically-minded society. She values personal freedom and responsibility,

a cornerstone of Gen X identity. Hopes and dreams.

And in her 40s and beyond, her aspirations undergo a significant shift from external

validation to internal fulfillment. The dream is no longer about pleasing others,

but also about self-discovery, personal growth,

and reinvention. There is a powerful belief that 40 is the new 20,

not in a desperate attempt to reclaim youth, but as an embrace of a

new chapter of bringing the vitality and wisdom. She hopes to feel confident,

powerful, and comfortable in her own skin. This feeling is often interwined with a

sense of accomplishment. With the financial comfort and physical well-being she now enjoys,

or things she has actively earned through decades of hard work and self-discipline,

she creates unique experiences of her material possessions and values quality time with family

and friends above all else. Victories and failures.

Her greatest victory is internal. A surge in confidence that is well-documented.

Research shows that while women are often less confident,

than men in their 20s and 40s, they not only catch up by age

40, but continue to grow in confidence, eventually surpassing their male counterparts by age

60. This is a source of immense pride.

She has likely achieved significant milestones in her career and has built a stable

financial foundation. Her perceived failures,

however, are deeply personal and often feel like a betrayal by her own body.

This is good. Interesting insight, right?

The most profound struggle arises when the health diet and exercise regimens that she

diligently followed for decades suddenly stop working.

The hormonal shifts of perimenopause and menopause bring about changes,

wrinkles, waking fatigue, that feel entirely out of her control.

This isn't just a cosmetic issue, it's a full-blown identity crisis.

The effortless attention my looks garnered got me addicted to being pretty,

not to mention in spite of something in my control.

This is a weird quote I got from Gemini, so I won't sugarcoat that

one, right? But there's a lot to go through here, so just stick with

me for the video. This quote reveals the core psychological tension this woman faces,

a growing chasm between her internal state and her external reality.

Internally, she's more confident, wise, disciplined, and powerful than ever before.

Externally, she feels her appearance is declining in ways that defy her control and

discipline. This is not simple vanity,

it is a profound and deeply felt injustice that her physical self no longer

reflects the vibrant, capable, and resilient woman she has become.

A product that can convincingly promise to rely on her outer appearance for

inner strength will tap into one of her most powerful emotional needs.

The most effective messaging will speak to restoring the reflection to match the reality

of who you've become. So I want to talk about this for a second,

because I was going through it, and I'm obviously doing an eye serum and

other skincare products, and I, you know, I thought it was interesting.

I made a note of it somewhere, and it's not a perfect copy,

but I think they're saying around like,

you know, it's profoundly unfair how, you know, just as I start feeling more

confident and comfortable in my own skin,

that same skin, outwardly, that same skin starts to betray me.

There's a really, that's a good, that's a good line of copy.

That's a good thing to test,

whether it's an advertorial, a sales letter, whatever it is.

And so you get that from what you've read so far.

What outside forces do they believe have prevented their best life?

While she is frustrated by societal beauty standards that glorify youth,

her most acute blame is directed at two primary forces.

First is her own biology, specifically the tumultuous and often unspoken challenges of perimenopause

and menopause, which she feels unprepared for and abandoned in.

Second is a medical community that she believes has systematically dismissed,

under-researched, and misunderstood women's health. She feels profoundly sighted that no one adequately warned

her about the physical and mental challenges of this life stage.

Combine that with women being understudied and dismissed by the medical community in a

gross and systemic way, not to mention the personal health leading up to menopause,

that is perimenopause, where your body fails you and 10,000 other symptoms emerge other

than traditional hot flashes, it's like you're getting a new body,

face, brain, in a bad way, and you don't recognize yourself.

This is a really powerful quote, right? This feeling of being unheard and dismissed

has cultivated a deep-seated prejudice against being patronized or having your experience minimized.

Prejudices. Her life experiences armed her with a healthy set of prejudices.

She is deeply skeptical of and prejudiced against gimmicky marketing,

shallow social media, influencers, and brands that lack transparency and authenticity.

She harbors a strong suspicion of miracle creams and often holds the belief that

simple, old-fashioned solutions like Vaseline or even just good genetics are more effective than

expensive, overhyped products. This skepticism is evolving into a broader prejudice against the mainstream

beauty, food, and pharmaceutical industries, which she increasingly views as fundamentally corrupt and untrustworthy.

Remember, we talked about that corruption, so that's interesting. To sum it up in

one to three sentences, life is a journey of continuous growth where resilience,

self-belief, and authenticity are true measures of worth,

not fleeting external appearances. Love and family are the essential anchors that must be

nurtured and protected with fierce loyalty. A well-lived life is about finding a balance

between personal freedom and profound responsibility,

value and function over fills, and quality over quantity in all things.

Part two, the crowded battlefield navigating the anti-aging market.

Okay, what's the market already using?

The 40 plus woman's approach to skincare is multifaceted,

incorporating a blend of accessible drugstore finds,

prestigious brands, potent active ingredients,

and professional treatments. She's an educated consumer actively seeking out specific ingredients known for

their efficacy. Topical products. Her bathroom cabinet is a testament to her research containing

a mix of products at various price points.

Mass market brands, which then lists a bunch of prestigious dermatologists endorsed

brands. When she decides to invest more,

she turns to high-end brands known for their clinical backing and potent formulations and

key ingredients sought. Her shopping list is ingredient driven.

She actively seeks out products containing retinol,

vitamin C, hyaluronic acid, peptides,

ceramitides, niacinamide, and most importantly,

broad spectrum SPF. And office treatments.

She views professional treatments as a serious,

results-oriented option. Botox is a common consideration,

sometimes referred to as a secret weapon. She also researches and considers fillers like

Juvederm, laser treatments, and chemical peels to address volume loss,

texture, and deeper wrinkles. To make these high-stakes decisions,

she turns to online communities and review platforms like RealSelf to gather information and

patient experiences. And there are at-home devices.

What has her experience been like? What does she like about them?

Well, her satisfaction is directly linked,

or tied, to tangible results. She expresses genuine enthusiasm for products to actually

work. She appreciates sophisticated formulations with lightweight,

non-greasy textures that absorb well without feeling heavy or clogging pores.

This is really important. I talked about the greasy thing,

I think, with, uh, Wiptallo, and we came up,

and we looked there. Like, that's an important thing to understand,

right? A key driver of her positive sentiment is value.

She loves finding affordable products from brands like The Ordinary or CeraVe that outperform

their more expensive counterparts. Um,

I used to love Bare Minerals Powder Foundation, but found as I got older,

the Bare Minerals kind of sat on the skin rather than blending in and

really emphasized all my pores.

The Laura Geller really does melt in well, feels super lightweight,

and is so quick to put on. This comment highlights her need for products

to adapt to her changing skin, preferring formulas that melt in rather than sit

on the skin. What does the market,

See, that's good. This is, Why does this matter?

If I'm doing skincare, I should talk about stuff like it melts into your

skin, it absorbs, it doesn't sit on the top, right?

It really gets deeply absorbed. These are important things for me to know when

I talk to my market. What I dislike.

Her primary most passionately expressed frustration is the feeling of being cheated,

spending significant amounts of money on products that are ultimately useless.

She feels her intelligence is assaulted by overblown claims.

And I'm not the type of woman to blow big money on useless products

and then delude myself that they are making a difference.

She dislikes products marketed for mature skin that are formulated with heavy,

greasy textures that can exacerbate issues by caking in lines or emphasizing pores.

It's a really good note, right? Another major point of friction is the retail

experience itself. She feels misunderstood and patronized by young seniors.

Sales associates, particularly at beauty superstores like Sephora,

who lack life experience, they'll lack life experience to comprehend the unique challenges of

40 plus skin. Sephora is not so great if you're over 30.

Nearly every store I've been in doesn't have a single sales associate over 25-ish.

You need to find a sales associate that is around your age and who

has the youthful look you want. Are there horror stories?

The most pervasive horror stories is the cumulative financial and emotional toll of decades

spent on a seemingly endless cycle of hope and disappointment.

It is the slow downing realization that the thousands of dollars invested have yielded

minimal results. More acute horror stories also exist.

A common one involves the harsh side effects of powerful ingredients when used without

proper guidance. For example, a woman who eagerly tries prescription strength treads

annoying, believing it to be a gold standard,

only to experience severe peeling, redness, and irritation that makes her skin look worse.

Another deeply felt horror story is the moment of panic when she realizes her

trusted, lifelong makeup routine suddenly works against her,

settling into her fine lines and making her appear older and more tired than

she feels. This experience is not just frustrating,

it is a moment of betrayal by products she once relied on.

Do they think the existing solutions work? If not,

why? Overwhelmingly, the market is characterized by profound skepticism.

A strong undercurrent of belief persists that most topical skincare products will not work

in any meaningful way. Many women in this demographic have concluded that the true

determinants of how one ages are non-negotiable factors like genetics,

consistence, sun protection, and a

healthy lifestyle, particularly diet and not smoking. They believe that once a wrinkle is

formed, no cream can magically erase it. There's a quote saying that,

right? A bit of moisturizer might make it feel softer for a bit,

but that's really all. Any time you ask an older woman with good skin

what she uses, it always seems to be something,

the most simple thing, like Nevea. Just plain water,

olive oil, and in this case, Vaseline, right?

The reason for this disbelief is twofold. First,

they believe the beauty industry is fundamentally built on selling hope in a jar,

a metaphor that perfectly captures their view of exaggerated marketing claims and unfulfilled promises.

Secondly, they feel the industry has failed to formulate products that address the specific

biological realities of their skin. As estrogen declines,

skin becomes drier, more sensitive, and loses elasticity.

In ways that are distinct from earlier life stages,

they feel most products do not adequately account for these complex hormonal changes.

One thing if we think critically that is interesting,

right, is they tend to not like the phrasing or expression of,

like, mature skin, uhm,

but, then at the same time,

they want products that are for their skin,

which is, you know, I think it's the term mature, which I get.

This leads to a fascinating conclusion. In psychological state, the efficacy paradox.

This consumer is trapped between her deep experience, space skepticism,

the products work, and her persistent hopeful search for a solution.

She declares she won't be fooled by useless products, yet her purchasing habits show

she is willing to try, try a wide array of brands.

She asserts that no cream can remove wrinkles, yet she actually seeks recommendations for

products that actually work. This paradox is not a sign of irrationality,

but a deeply human hope against experience. She is not- out.

Not looking for another fantasy, she is searching for the one credible exception to

the rule. The most poem-marking message will not be,

this is magic, it'll be, we know you're skeptical,

you have every right to be, here's the transparent science-back exception you've been searching

for. And it talks about the different ingredients and what's their perceived efficacy,

cost of effort ratio, consumer trust level,

and then quotes, which is really cool, right? So I've written all my secret

weapon to smooth-line lines, uneven skin tone,

and rough texture is an- No. Over-the-counter retinol serum,

but I had to go through trial and error to find the right one,

retinol can be irritating to smooth-line skin, particularly if you're not using it,

vitamin C. As a bee or as vitamin C in everything these days,

my go-to splurge is a dermatological, biolumine-c serum.

My skin is so glowy, I often skit makeup. Vitamin C can be inactivated

by light, so you want to steer clear of vitamin C products that come

in a clear bottle, hyonic acid.

A few drops of this hyonic and B5 hydrating serum in skin appears immediately

plumper and more hydrated, hands down, is my absolute favorite hyonic blend ever.

Servee, the Ordinary School, says some brands,

Botox, things like that, right? So this is valuable, we're getting quotes from what

they like. They're like, alright.

You know, forgotten, curious, so to speak. Has someone tried to solve the market's

pain point before in a unique way? The narrative of a unique,

almost magical solution to aging is not new.

It is deeply historical root-sick. Thank you In plain example,

is a story surrounding the toilet of beauty of Madame du Lette Reclamier,

a celebrated 19th century French socialite renowned for enduring flawless complexity.

Legend held that her secret was a special formula,

which was later marketed in the late 1800s by the American entrepreneur,

Harriet Hubbard, Iyer. The there crafted by Iyer was a masterpiece

of mystique and exclusivity. A toilet of a secret cream is formed by a

pass down through generations of French nobility. The result was commercial success,

proving the power of a compelling story rooted in a historical lore

and a forgotten secret. However,

the story has a cautionary post-grip that resonates with the modern

consumer's

skepticism. There

are came here products were later exposed by the Boston Journal of Health as

being made of cheap, ordinary, and even harmful ingredients like mercury.

This historical anecdote perfectly capsulates the dual appeal and parallel of secret cures,

tapping the- the desire for lost bosom while simultaneously validating modern day distrust of

marking claims. Still, that's an interesting story,

something you could potentially dive into, learn more about,

and maybe find things to use in storytelling driven- driven.

Marketing for, uh, especially in a VSL.

Is there a conspiratorial story behind why other solutions don't work?

A powerful narrative that aligns with the consumer's distrust of established institutions is a

story of royal, Raymond Reif, an American inventor in the early- to mid-20th century.

Reif was a brilliant scientist who developed revolutionary microscopes and claimed to have invented

a beam-ray device capable of destroying pathogenic organisms,

including those responsible for- Okay. He was by vibrating them at their mortal oscillatory

rate with specific electromagnetic frequencies.

His work was not fringe, it was documented in repeatable publications,

including the 1994 annual report of the Smithsonian Institution.

This is super interesting, by the way, I've never heard this before.

This conspiratorial element enters a subsequent- and- suppression of his work.

According to the narrative, which was revived in the 1980s and persists in alternative

health communities, Reif's groundbreaking non-invasive heli technology- He was systematically discredited and buried

by the American Medical Association, and a powerful medical pharmaceutical complex.

Reif himself died penniless and imbedded, blaming the conspiracy by organized medicine for intimidating

his colleagues and rejecting his findings. Uh,

the story provides a ready-made test over his big energy framework,

alone genius who is with a revolutionary cure for humanity,

is soured by a corrupt establishment that profits from disease.

For a consumer who already feels dismissed by the local community,

the center of his . . conceptually, affirming commercial medicine as a villain and

alternative, ah, suppressed knowledge as a path to trivialing.

So I mean, this one's not really specific to skincare,

but maybe talked about skincare. I don't know. So you can dive deeper into,

right? I've talked about this in the past. There's a fine balance between being

a factfinder and taking too long. And also embracing rabbit holes,

right? Like . . . me, I'm always curious.

I think a fundamental quality of really to copy right?

It's curiosity. And so .

. I think this is something where, you know,

I don't know. I'm curious about this. I'm gonna look it up in the

future. Are there any older attempts to solve this problem?

Long before the advent of complex chemical formulations and quick-fix marketing approaches to skincare

are more holistic, process-oriented, and reliant on natural whole ingredients.

These forgotten methods offer compelling alternatives to the modern,

often-disciplined skincare landscape. The wisdom of mid-century rituals.

The beauty routines of the 1940s and 50s were not about a single empirical

product, but meticulous, multi-step ritual. An evening routine which may involve a cream-based cleanse,

a period of rest with which hazel pads .

. over the ice-reduced puffiness, a warm bath,

and careful application of emolins, like .

. Lanolin-rich creams or simple patrolling jelly to the face and neck and eye

area overnight. The emphasis was on preservation,

gentle nourishment, and process Offset. It started contrasting the modern promise of instant results

from a single bottle. Ancient and Victorian natural recipes.

Delving further back, skincare was intrinsically linked to the kitchen in the garden.

In ancient Greece, beauty was synonymous with nature. All alone,

honey and honey were fundamental staples. He was not only in their diet,

but also topically for cleansing, moisturizing, and partying a healthy glow.

Victorian home apothecary.

Victorian era beauty manuals for five recipes for homemade options using greens like French

cucumber juice, almond oil, rose water, and witch hazel.

Cold creams, the primary moisturizer of the time,

were made from simple greens like lard, wax,

and scent of oils prepared at home without synthetic reservoirs or chemicals.

So it's kinda interesting to talk about, like, what people, Why is this interesting?

Well, again, like, if we go back, let me whip Talo for me,

right? I'm gonna research it for an ice cream,

but I have a, a Talo that I'm also selling. And it's like,

okay, simplicity based on, To use lard,

the Victorian area, maybe send out the Victorian era secret,

right? There's all kinds of, what ideas can I get from this that I

can use my marketing, right? That's a huge part of it. You're trying to

understand your market and their hopes and dreams,

but we're also trying to get ideas. So it's how to speak to them,

what to say, its angles, right? This is all,

these are all reasons why research is so important. They've forgotten ingredients spotlight,

bear, bear extract. Amidst a wealth of historical remedies,

specific ingredients to, And now it's haven't been forgotten by the mainstream beauty industry.

One such example is bear, bear, bear extract derived from the uva or sea

plant. This particular extract is a natural source of arguudin,

a compound that the body converts into hydroquinone,

quinone, or the most effective known agents for lightening skin and reducing hyperpigmentation.

While synthetic, hydroquinone is a common but controversial prescription ingredient.

Brilliant. Due to the potential side effects, bear, bear, bear extract offers a gentler,

nature, derived pathway to the same benefits, niche brands are now reproducing this forgotten

ingredient as a safe, effective, and natural solution for the key concerns of the

40 plus consumer, positioning it as a piece of lost wisdom we discovered.

That's really interesting and good to know too. The monitor trail,

how our road wages were on our skin correction.

The belief of the pain point used to not exist or was not so

bad. That's it I'm

gonna

go through this one in really in-depth, and then future ones won't be as

in-depth, but I want to at least go through the first sort of set.

And again, then I'll show you how to leave parts to the- So again,

and- but like I said at the beginning of this, it's- it's worthwhile to

read through it.

I think it's- at least once, right? Okay.

Foundational belief within this demographic is that the skin problems they face,

chronic inflammation, premature aging, pervasive sensitivity,

dark spots and puffiness, are not an inevitable part of aging,

but distinctly modern affliction. This belief is rooted in personal observations.

In an anecdote, they look at older generations, their mothers and grandmothers- my mother's.

They see women who age gracefully without access to the billion dollar anti-aging industry.

My mom was 65 and has gorgeous skin. She always says her secret is

sunscreen and hats. My grandma's 85 looks quite a bit younger and did all

the things in her younger years that you're not supposed to do to drink

smoked tan. The woman on that side of the family just had really good

skin. The symbol of comment perfectly encapsulates the core of the belief.

Something has fundamentally changed between their grandmother's generation and their own.

The logical conclusion they draw is that the- Um,

is not with them, both modern- the modern environment they inhabit.

The suspicion is further solidified by reports of pre-industrialized or isolated cultures that appear

to have far better skin reinforcing the ideas that are contemporary lifestyle is the

primary culprit. That's interesting going back to like the tribes and things,

right? So, reference 48, I would go look at what that is in Gemini

and click on it, right? Um,

which we may even do. Please. I that it's been recently exacerbated by outside

forces. This consumer has identified a clear set of villains in her narrative powerful

external forces she believes are actually harming her health and exploring the aging of

her skin. These forces are not abstract, they are specific industries and historical shifts

that she feels portrayed, uh, her trust. If they didn't want the cartridge,

food supply. I think, you know, here, like,

it's all Ansel Keys in my example,

and so it went with this. So I actually took it out and- the

additional examples I did, because it was kind of dumb.

Umm, there's nothing wrong with this.

I actually do think there's a- there actually is validity.

I just think it only picked Ansel Keys because of the example.

Because it is, like, you know, sugar, cars that create inflammation,

glycation where sugar molecules attach to collagen and elastin fibers,

make it into a different brittle. Umm, across- a primary driver of wrinkles sagging

over all skin, degradation. Thanks. Umm,

degradation. Umm, but again, this is sort of not, like,

it wouldn't have picked Ansel Keys if I hadn't had that example,

so I removed it for the prompt.

Villain to you the unseen chemical assault. Umm,

it's kind of interesting, they mention, uh, glycer fate and green enra- Up,

like, you know, it's all the food supply. Disrupts hormone

systems and can create skin issues, right?

Umm, and it's sort of the duplicitous beauty industry.

So the idea that, like, basically, the beauty industry is putting in known

toxins and crosagens that make wrinkles worse.

And then, of course, social media, right? Umm.

The isolate unclipped ultimate proof. Complete the narrative of monocrossions needs proof that a

different reality is possible. This proof is found in the existence of isolated, non-westernized

populations who are free from the skin illness of plague or case study and

purity. Studies in actual reports from populations like the Catavian Islanders of Papua

New Guinea and the Atchor tribe of the Amazon revealed near total absence of

acne and other inflammatory skin conditions. These groups since- exist on a diet of

whole, unprocessed foods, fruits, vegetables, tubers,

and fish that have no exposure to the processed foods to find sugars,

dairy, and environmental chemicals to the western world. The Separa tribe,

a living before and after. A particularly powerful story is that of the Separa

tribe and the Ecuadorian Amazon. According to one account,

the tribe has historically free from acne. However, once petroleum companies brought access to

the modern world, the younger generation began consuming processed foods like yogurt and ice

cream. The result acne began to appear for the first- In this this antidote

functions as a perfect, easy to understand, morality tale.

When the modern corrupted diet arrived, their perfect skin disappeared.

Uh, building credibility by debunking myths.

They're talking about, I don't think this is that important, but they have,

like, some interesting stuff around, um,

the Huns of People of Pakistan. So I guess,

that was some information. I think it's so important. Um,

it's a powerful original sin narrative, but I don't think I have.

Let me go back to my, It's kind of funny, because I mentioned the

Garden of Eden and the original sin thing.

I didn't mention that. I didn't mention,

but I didn't mention, I mentioned in this video, but I didn't mention it

specifically in the prompt. But it's kind of interesting how Gemini picks

up on that, right? The consumer is not personally at fault for wrinkles,

dark spots, puffy eyes. She's a victim of a series of systemic-systemic portrayals.

Again, the- the dietary thing, I really wish- if I was doing this myself,

I might rerun it. Um, if I was writing a copy right now for

this, it's okay, but the answer key thing isn't that important.

Um,

it sums it up, okay? So that was a lot. Was that citation 48

I would look at? Why indigenous people don't have acne? Umm,

this is interesting, let's see. So this is about a woman took

a trip to, like, the Ecuadorian jungle, and saw all these indigenous tribes.

Another had acne, I've had good skin. That's

interesting, right? This is probably something there,

especially for more of, like, a clickbait style VSL.

So, that was a cool find from deep research,

okay? Now, I ran the same prompt in perplexity.

Is that the same prompt? Perplexity is shorter?

But, it's kinda nice in a way, okay?

Your customer is primarily U.S. woman aged 40 plus experienced visible signs of aging

including wrinkles, dark, spots, and puffy eye bags. These women are navigating the complex

intersection of pairing, menopause, career pressures, family responsibilities,

and evolving beauty standards. So, this is a much more succinct way of saying

what Jim and I were saying before, right? This is up the sandwich thing

here, right? They represent a demographic caught between societal expectations of youth- people appearance,

and the natural aging process often feeling suddenly confronted with traumatic skin changes.

As one woman on a menopause form express, I guess this is not specifically

a menopause question, just a general gain old and ugly and seeking advice on

skin care to reduce lines on my face, especially upper lips.

Sorry, I got some double checking one thing here.

Another shared, I was in my mid-50's when I started going through the menopause-

the fluctuating hormones cause outbreaks of acne in my face,

especially around my chin area. I thought I left this way back in my

teenage years, so it was a confidence knock to worry about bad skin again.

Where are their attitudes, right? They often turn to spiritual practices in middle age.

Political attitudes, they tend to be more left-leaning than men.

Umm, that's, you'll get to know,

subtle attitudes. Umm,

the challenge, traditional aging stereotype- type. While simultaneously feeling pressure from beauty standards.

99% of women over 50 are afraid of aging,

yet 22% feel less pressure to meet beauty standards compared to younger women.

Economic attitudes. If you have,

you know, considerable spending power. So honestly,

it's up to you. If you want to run Gemini, or if you just

want to run perplexity, I actually think this is doing a really nice job

of sort of summarizing things, right? Umm,

they're hopes and dreams. 8 9 8 8 8 9 And give a little

more specificity. Like,

they, so we saw this with Gemini, right? They're coming into their own,

living their authentic selves.

Living without self-judgment. Right?

These things are, you know, new adventures, personal growth,

maintaining professional relevance, work-life balance,

looking feeling their best. Thank you. That's despite their age. One woman shared,

I focused on enhancing skin strength, boosting collagen, and the less than production.

And she made more useful from an appearance, especially looking less weather to rough,

okay? Victory's are failures. Kind of,

though Gemini said too, now we can career advancement,

uh, more resilience and confidence, more financial independence failure.

Feeling that they failed at preventing aging despite trying numerous products,

experiencing unexpected skin problems that damage self-confidence,

struggling before- wake balance. As woman expresses frustration,

many options have tried to prevent ineffective, like those from the ordinary.

I'm not interested in spending a lot on products that don't deliver results.

I would say that genuinely makes the difference. What about outside forces?

Well, hormonal changes,

I think this is an important one that we're seeing, you know,

a pattern on, you know, Gemini in here,

societal ageism and beauty standards. standard. Things. Gender wage gaps.

Maybe. What was mentioned by Gemini? Fair.

Family caregiving responsibilities. Lack of accurate information.

Where are their prejudices? Against younger women's beauty advantages.

Feeling that youth has unfair advantages and appearance opportunities.

Opportunities. Against the beauty industry. Believing companies exploit women's insecurities for profit.

Against natural aging. Acceptance. Rejecting the notion that they should be gracefully.

This should gracefully accept aging. We'll you in the environmental.

Against expensive products. Skeptical of high price.

Concair due to past disappointments. Core belief.

Uhm, they believe the family remains central to the identity but they deserve to

prioritize their own needs and dreams alongside caregiving responsibilities.

They value authentic relationships over surface level connections and believe that personal growth and

self improvement should continue through life. Rejecting society's expectations that they should become invisible

or relevant with age. Other s-s solutions.

This is kinda nice. It's a little bit more similar to what was said

in Gemini. Uhm,

what's your experience been like? Trial and error approach.

Inconsistent results. Skin sensitivity.

Financial drain. One user shared,

I have zero clue what to trust in which reviewers online to believe.

Another expressed, it doesn't do anything. I paid twenty three hundred dollars.

Twenty hundred something for a thirty milliliter of products and same results.

What do they like? Professional treatments. P. Low science based routines.

Product proven ingredients. Trusted reviews.

What do they not like? Lack of regulation. Unrealistic marketing claims.

High prices. Complex routines. Generic solutions.

Poor stories. Superior skin reactions.

This is from Mercury poisoning from historical beauty products.

I wouldn't pay too much to do that. Cause I can less I was

doing really focused on historical stories.

Part of my copy. Uhm,

financial expertise. ... exploitation. Dangerous agreements.

Day believe solutions work. Their deeply skeptical.

Which is what Gemini said too. Umm,

To just understand that right? They have more sort of ancient things here. Like,

Social media pressure, stress and lifestyle factors.

They blame the industry, lack of regulation, all that.

Umm,

It didn't really do a great job of the indigenous stuff compared to Gemini,

so that's where I think it's worthwhile to do multiple LMs.

I went a little bit faster on this one because I, you know, We've

a lot to get through, but I wanted you to go to see, like,

what, uh, You know,

another example here. And so now,

I put this into this here as well. Let's look in just a moment

here at ChatGPT. Okay, I don't want to read this

whole thing, but I want you to see the difference,

okay? And I'm going to show you how to combine all of these into

one thing. Okay, often 40,

46 plus range, experiencing visible signs of aging,

having mid-life, transitions, approach to menopause,

considering second careers. Umm,

large portion of white, not exclusively,

they invest in skincare.

And so really, again, I don't want to have to go through all this,

but,

It's good, you can see it from closer, right? It felt to take care

of the looks earlier. Nobody told me how quickly things can go downhill.

I was actually attracted back then. Looks aren't important.

It was easy to say when I was young. So I would go through

and look at the quotes here. Umm,

I feel destined to be low now. Who wants to be a retired saggy,

chunky woman. I'm laughing, it's sad,

right? Um, a period of grieving what I used to look like.

So I think Chatching T can do a- It's really good job, especially pulling

quotes here. I'm leaving

access to all of these, right? They've got four stories,

bosh cosmetic procedures, Botox four stories.

I actually really like chat TBTs. I'll put a role on it.

I'm skimming it. I was Cleopatra again.

Hemorrhoid, Snowmucin, Brownies,

which we have a Snowmucin product for our stuff.

Umm, retinoids. They're the Victorian stuff again,

which is interesting to me.

I do wonder if there's a cool Victorian skincare secret angle to be used

in the future. 1920s.

I think 50s Hollywood tricks. I think that's interesting. I think there's a powerful

nostalgia. Umm,

parabrication A, H gets mentioned again.

Uh, these taper facial straps to pull back skin for photos or events,

thread lifts, um,

old school plastic surgery. I mean, there's really interesting stuff.

If I was actually, why I'm frankly later going to probably do a VSL

for the ice room, and I will read this in more detail.

I just don't want to do it all in this video,

because I think you get the idea and I don't want to bore you

to death. Umm, it's okay,

cool. We've got all three. So, I put this into a doc.

All the, all these things are, you know, shared with you.

What I want to show you is like, okay, one cool thing you can

do. You can pick and choose, right? So,

I would usually run on probably at least two of the three.

I typically might do- Just like M&I and chat GPT.

I might throw in perplexity. Umm,

well, like, that's a lot of information. And even if we go to give

it to an LLM, is that too much information? It would be like kind

of some of us repetitive. What can we do,

right? What we can do is,

we can do a prompt like this for quad. Make this bigger.

I'm raised for sales copy to- 8 target towards a specific demographic.

I've had multiple LLMs generate deep research reports from me on this demographic and

I'm attaching each of those as a PDF here. What I'd like your help

with is to go through these reports and then create one unified report that

I can use as a reference. For greater context,

serious, the prompt I give to LLMs for deep research.

And I just include the prompt again. Please go ahead and create the document

now. So you can see what this looks like, okay? I did the exact

same prompt and I uploaded a PDF from the Gemini research,

perplexity, and chat GBT.

So then it takes this and creates one unified brief.

And so frankly, if you're going to do this and run through things, I

again, I still wouldn't typically read through and I would jot down.

What I'd be doing is it's super important and maybe I'm assuming you would

do this when you might not. I'd be jotting down ideas as I'm going.

I'd have a good. Another doc open. Every time I see something interesting,

like what I pointed out as I'm going, I'd be jotting down notes and

things like that to further explore if I need to and want to,

right? Umm. Okay. Your customer is a U.S. I'll do it in here. I

can make it bigger. Easier. Your customer is a

U.S. woman aged 40 plus experiencing visible signs of aging.

Uh, she represents the unique and demanding life stage.

Her peak earning years, higher disposal income than younger,

younger generations. Copping to sell expectations of youthful appearance and natural aging process.

Mention the sandwich generation and chief milk officers from Gemini.

It did take a lot from Gemini, but I went through this. It does

have stuff from Chappie, GBTA perplexity as well.

And her own words, right? Um.

So

it's got, like, quotes from her own words, what attitudes does she have?

She can turn to spiritual practices. She probably leans left.

That was from, uh, perplexity, I think, not Gemini.

Suicidal attitudes, right?

Challenging traditional stereotypes, waffle and pressure.

This quote, which I think was important in the worthwhile. Um.

I think these were from Chad's bt,

some of them. She's got great spending power,

but she's pragmatic. What are hopes and dreams? Right?

Feeling confident, powerful and comfortable in her own skin,

looking as young as she feels, or at least feeling refreshing and confident,

pursuing new adventures and personal growth opportunities,

maintaining professional relevance and advancement, achieving the work life balance,

what caring for family. In her own words,

we saw this one here. Umm,

my skin looks more alive, my face often lifted,

and my eyes don't feel so droop anymore. 76% say they're actually trying to

embrace aging with grace and confidence, but are the victories and failures.

victories, the internal surge of confidence we talked about,

and could effectively become more confident than men by 60.

That was, so that was an important thing we noticed that Claude noted here

too. Right? Successfully navigating career advancement and family responsibilities,

big miles. Both zones, confidence, failures.

This is a really important one that it added,

or it picked up on, feeling like they failed at providing aging despite trying

numerous products, but found struggle when health diet and exercise regimens that worked for

decades suddenly stopped working, hormonal shifts,

apparent menopause and menopause, experiencing unexpected skin problems that damage self-control,

in their own words. After those attention,

my looks got already got me addicted to the aging pretty, not to mention,

in spite of all my, I don't know why it does this quote or

we can't even, I don't know why I picked this quote to pull it

to be honest with you. Um, you know, I've tried these things that are

ineffective, we saw this quote, nobody told me how fast things can go downhill.

I really like that quote, so I'm glad it pulled it. What forces outside

their, do they believe would prevent their best life,

biology, medical, dismissal, ageism,

social media pressure, quotes about that.

Uh, what are their prejudices against younger women to be the advantages,

against the beauty industry, against miracle creams,

against expensive products, against cosmetic procedures,

in our own words. Uh,

and I'm not the type of one to blow big money on useless products

and then to loot myself that they are making a difference. Some of my

friends are beginning to do things to their face, I often think,

and I often think the botox, the photos of botox make their face look

unnatural and definitely do no- not look better than when they were younger.

Their core beliefs get summed here, it has some additional core beliefs,

right? Other existing solutions,

mass market prestige, key ingredients,

professional treatments, at-home devices, supplements,

buzzer experience, bin-like. I think this was from,

uh,

Papoxity, which has to be T. I don't remember,

in our own words. This shit is hard,

I really thought it was going to skate through the whole thing gracefully, right?

That's a great- I think that must have been from Chad GPT. What does

a market like? Products that actually work.

You know, I can move it through all of this, in our own words,

what I dislike, feeling cheated, products marketed for mature skin,

to reach the experience of young sales associates who lack understanding,

lack of regulation, unrealistic marketing claims,

complex routines. in our solutions. We saw this before before.

Horror stories. You know.

I don't know if we need the mercury one again,

but did those, in our own words.

They believe existing solutions work. They don't believe most skin products

work in a meaningful way. Um,

the beauty industry is built outside of hope and jar. really glad it incorporated

that. I thought that was important. Mention the efficacy paradox trapped between deep skepticism

that products work and persistent hopeful search for a solution in our own words.

Talking about our skepticism and the natural step here.

Unique attempts and lost solutions and mentions both of these from

Gemini, which is interesting.

Mention is a Victorian thing, which is interesting.

Mention is like the mid-central mid-century,

pre-1960 things, which is good. And the corruption.

You have a lot of high gorgeous skin, acid forces.

Again, uh, annoyed at has this from Gemini,

but whatever. It does mention the support tribe story.

And so it does all that, right? So, if we,

the reason I went through all this here is because if we zoom out.

It's like, okay, good. It clearly,

um, is covering,

it kind of covered, it got most of the key things.

So again, ideally you will read through everything.

If you're sort of overwhelmed, just use this prompt,

put into the quad, or sorry, this prompt,

put the PDFs in the quad. You know,

get a really good summary, and you can save that here, like I did,

okay? So next I'm gonna look at a couple other things.

Umm, we'll talk about how a little bit deeper on pain points if you

want to, and then two more examples. So I'm gonna pause again for a

break for myself, and come back to the same video. We'll keep going.

Okay, I'm back. What I'm gonna do is I'm actually, I wanna,

I'll do a third video here.

But to end this video, I wanna show you one more thing. Which is,

if you do feel like you want even more pain points or things like

that, you can do a follow up prompt.

Thanks to help with continued deep research and leverage social signals like social media,

forums, et cetera, to provide the following, as many quotes as possible from women

describing their specific pain points around aging skin,

uh, looking older, it goes in so on,

we highlight that. So like, whatever the pain point is.

Um, I wanna hear about how they think about the specific pain points

here in their own words, as many quotes as possible from,

women,

in this case, but whoever your market is, describing the opposite.

Um,

what adjectives and other descriptors they use, right?

So, you can do that in the same thing.

So, for example, perplexity. Their apple is okay,

but then I ran this prompt, right? Um,

I'm 43, tomorrow, I'm feeling old. I had a baby in 2020, and I'm

turning gray. Sprinkles to rapidly appearing, and I'm knackered.

I'm only using knackered prior from the UK. Captures the overwhelming nature of multiple

Asian signs for mature, uh, uh,

appearance simultaneously during parent metabons.

I started experiencing metabons to symptoms last year after having a hissectomy.

The first thing I noticed was wrinkles and bags under my eyes, which seemed

to appear over- overnight. I pushed- initially put down to the fact that I

was so overly tired. Skin texture and quality changes.

The most upsetting thing for me was the dryness and the dullness.

My skin literally seemed to lose the school overnight.

I felt and looked exhausted. My skin became so dry,

it really showed the impact hormones can have on our skin. It feels like

insects crawling under my skin. We hear about the symptoms from so many women

who come to our Facebook group. I now understand it's due to a lack

of- I love you guys. I love you. Your chin, which means your skin

can't hold onto moisture. So it's really valuable if I'm- especially for the moisturizing

stuff, whether it's the eye serum or towel,

playing up the moisturizing component is really good,

right? Retaining moisture, more natural moisture,

less dryness, all that. The complexity of multiple issues.

While we were celebrating her 45th birthday, she pulled me aside from the party

to ask me why my- her skin seemed to be going crazy with dryness,

acne, and wrinkles simultaneously. Maybe chance. Or you can see it's You see it's

pretty . . How unfair is that? The fluctuating hormones cause outbreaks of acne

in my face, especially on my chin area. I haven't really saw that cool

before. Umm,

emotional impact. How are our heavy-laced cope of losing your looks and

maybe no longer turning heads in the way you used to? I wouldn't say

I feel invisible yet, but going out definitely takes longer and more effort.

You start to think that you're really falling apart. I'm experiencing lots of unfortunate

signs of aging in which- might not be a big deal to me if

I was only 25. Oh, she's at 25,

so she's a little too young, but there's still some good stuff here.

Crow's feet, under eye wrinkles, hollow circles,

under my eyes, lines around my mouth, and drawn out God.

Look, looking faces, teams have lost to us by touting puffness.

Umm,

and so basically, you know, I put these all into a document here,

which I believe. Where'd

I put that? Sorry. I don't have this opening in me a second. Poor.

So I did that in perplexity. I got more quotes. I basically just copying

pasted them into another Google Doc.

I did the same thing for, uhm,

I did it for Chatsy P.T. Uhm, I thought Chatsy P.T.s

were like,

okay.

It was sort of short, but they weren't bad.

Then I did as well.

And I basically just pulled some pain points and things there.

So again, I just got a piece of them, and this is good to

have even more stuff from your customers own words,

so that's why I'm sharing this. I don't think it's an essential,

but it doesn't hurt. Instead of making sense,

I just did those, and I literally popped them into.

Okay. Um,

an extra dock that just has everything. By the way,

I did ask Brock as well, and Brock's just was not very good.

It kind of gave me a few random people.

When it stands, I don't quote, Kate Winslet.

And it was pretty short. I had a total of cases and very good.

Try again. And I kind of like- It

was okay. Some of the pay points were okay.

Umm.

But I just simply like really added, like, beautiful,

expressive lines. It makes face interesting. It just didn't seem that good.

So I honestly didn't really- I wanted to show you Brock,

but I just didn't find him to be that good, to be honest with

you. So, I didn't include that.

Okay, but that's- So you can get more pay points. So in the next

video, I'll go through kind of briefly, more briefly,

I promise. The two examples for, um,

Airbnb arbitrage and then golf. Just so you can see a few more examples.

You'll have access to all of the outputs so you can go through them.

But, you know, to summarize,

we're- we'll do a second graphic research.

You know, why it's important, what we're looking for, how it generates ideas and

all these sorts of things. Then I went- in-depth through the outputs we get

with Gemini, um, a little bit less in-depth with Pervexity and ChatsyPT,

which you're able to see those. How you can put them all into Cloud

and have Cloud summarize it into one document that we could just read that

will simplify our life. And honestly, we'll catch 99% of what we want.

So if you don't have time, or don't feel- or if you feel overwhelmed

with all that stuff, you can go into Cloud,

um, and get a good summary that should be good enough,

um, in a perfect- We're going to go. I hope you read everything,

but if you don't, you'll still be okay. And then,

we talked about why this is important, right? So understanding their deeper drivers is

important as we speak to them, and speak to them in their own language.

Right? We can use quotes, structurally, and copy, basically,

and it's pretty genius. Um, but also,

we have ideas, and angles, and hooks, and things to explore,

and- to. Different types of bad copy as we go to write copy in

the future. So, I'll come back for a long,

I mean to you, it'll be whenever you watch the next video, and we'll

go through, um, biz-op and golf,

and we'll go from there. Alright, thanks. Thanks.
