Okay, let's continue on. Sorry,

I can't talk sometimes. Let's continue on with part two of this,

which Okay, come on. So we did the,

uh, through the lead in Klaudigan. Let's look at Gemini,

because I did like, uhm, I liked what I was seeing

with Gemini 2, so Let's

look at this. Okay, Laura. If you're a woman over the age of 35

who's been shocked by the sudden appearance of crow's feet,

under-eye wrinkles, or dark circles that make you look exhausted,

even when you're all rested. I'm gonna not read over the,

uh, voice video production notes,

so I don't mind them. And you've tried the expensive eye creams from department

stores, the so-called miracles you see in magazines,

maybe even professional treatments, but nothing seems to give you the results you were

hoping for. The one I'm about to reveal in the next few minutes will

be the most important breakthrough you've seen you'll ever discover for transforming your eye

area and getting back the youthful, confident look you truly deserve.

So please watch this short presentation to the very end,

I promise it'll be worth your while. So let's kind of compare that part,

right? Watch this to the very end, I promise it'll be worth your while.

For this one we had, uhm.

Do we have anything to watch to the very end?

Please watch every word of this presentation, because what you're about to learn will

change everything. So it's a little more disarming and personable,

right? Now, is this actually a great hook?

It's okay, but again, we're going to test more. Hi,

my name is Lauren, and I want to talk about that devastating moment,

the one that happens to so many of us. It's when you look in

the mirror one morning, and you're just don't recognize the tired,

aged face staring back at you. Maybe for you,

it was the crow's feet that seemed to appear overnight,

or the dark circles that no amount of sleep or concealer can seem to

hide, or maybe it's that delicate skin under your eye that's become thin and

crepey, losing its snap. It's a feeling of betrayal.

You feel vibrant and youthful on the inside, but your eyes are telling a

different story. Now, I want you to imagine something different.

Imagine waking up, looking in the mirror, and seeing eyes that are bright,

rest in peace. It's an alert, a true reflection of how you feel inside.

Imagine feeling so confident that you can go out with little or no makeup

on. Imagine getting compliments from friends and family, not asking if you're tired,

but tell you how refreshed and youthful you look. That transformation is possible,

and it has nothing to do with the expensive creams you've been using,

and in this presentation,

I'm going to share the heartbreaking story of how I, a busy mom of

two, right here in Florida, discovered the real reason why every single eye cream

had failed me, and why they're probably failing you,

too. You'll discover the shocking scientific truth about what's really happening at the cellular

level that causes your skin, the skin around your eyes,

to age so much faster than the rest of your face, and you'll finally

understand everything you've been told about collagen,

why everything you've been told about collagen loss is missing the most critical piece

of the puzzle. I'm going to reveal why 97% of eye creams are doomed

to fail, and it's not because of their ingredients, the hidden breakdown happening at

a microscopic level that no other product you've tried has ever addressed,

and why spending so much money on luxury brands often makes the problem worse.

What I've learned from a lean anti-aging physician with over 30 years of experience,

Dr. Blaine Schilling, changed everything I thought I knew about skincare.

This is information that the billion-dollar beauty industry does not want you to know.

This is specifically for women over 35 who are tired of wasting money and

are ready for real, science-backed solutions that deliver visible results.

Now, I know this might sound too good to be true. Believe me,

I was the world's biggest skeptic, especially after being disappointed so many times before.

But stick with me, you'll soon hear from one like Carol,

Patricia, and Elizabeth who have seen incredible transformations,

all because they learned about this one simple yet revolutionary shift in how to

approach high-aging.

So, I'm honestly kind of torn when I look at the two,

okay? I think this one is more authentic-sounding,

but this one does probably hit the direct response B.

Like, I like that this

one says,

you know, an anti-aging,

you know, chance me of a lean anti-aging physician.

Like I like the kind of,

like, mystery there. Um,

this breakthrough works.

This one would include the testimonials.

you're

ready

to finally understand why nothing has worked for you before and discover the one

approach that actually targets the root cause via aging, then please watch every word

of this presentation. So we look at the,

uh, end of the lead for this one.

Doesn't really end with a strong promise, right? And then it's still going in

about Opal Beauty. Which I don't like.

Now maybe Klaude does it too. But I don't think so. Klaude,

because Klaude has a reference VSL, Klaude does it a bit better. Now,

that being said, do I think this copy is decent?

It's decent. I could absolutely have it keep going.

It doesn't cost me that much. so we

need

to have stuff right to like have it just do the additional sections.

It's not there's not a ton of harm in doing that because what if

I end up seeing something that I think is better.

Now, this is where it can get a little bit wonky because,

well, that was Gemini. What about Klaude

4.0 Opus? What about ChatGPT 0.3,

0.4? What about this? What about that? Right, like you can destroy yourself with

possibilities. The short answer is,

and this will be a controversial statement, the short answer is

what the AI is going to write, whether it's Gemini or

ChachiPT, or Manus,

or whatever, I don't use Manus, but like, or Claude,

whatever version of them. That's a newer version,

is going to be better than what 99% of copywriters would write on their

own. And I say this as somebody who has reviewed

endless copy, thousands and thousands and thousands

and thousands of pieces of copy, who still reviews 20

plus pieces of copy a week. At least

it's going to be better than what most, almost every copywriter was going to

write on their own. Now knowing concepts,

learning things from RBC2, are you going to be,

are you going to be able to make it even better than just what

the LLM put out? but at the very end of the day,

rather than agonizing over every decision,

which some people who get into copywriting do,

they're like, yes, but what about this thing? Somebody said this tip.

Somebody said that I should use NLP.

Somebody said that I should never say this one word.

It's like, you are doing

yourself a disservice. It's better to get a great first draft.

Tweak, modify, edit, and ship,

right? Uhm,

so between these, there's elements that I can both. I'm gonna have it keep

going. It's not bad. I'm gonna say,

yes, please keep. Because I might as well in the background.

But I'm gonna focus on Claude.

What I could do, I could read through this version too.

Maybe it does the UML thing. Maybe it section better than Claude does.

Maybe it does a little section better. Maybe it has a couple lines. I

could add those in. Combine them. That's cool,

right? Uhm,

but I'm not going to lose sleep over it.

So let's get to the background story. See how it goes.

My name is Laura, and just like you,

I'm a busy mom. So, right here,

I don't like that it assumes. Like, for example,

sorry, one more note. The Gemini thing about,

uh, I want to talk about

that devastating moment that happens for some of us.

I'm going to, for sure, use this copy and not this copy,

uh, the copy and Claude where it assumes this stuff,

right? Just like you, I'm a busy mom, like,

okay, well, are you? Are you for sure a busy mom?

I can go through the whole background story here, but like,

so I wouldn't talk about finding opal beauty in a VSL.

I would be like, Hey, my name is Laura. I'm not a skincare expert.

Before I discovered any of this, or was known as like a,

kind of a go-to skincare expert. I was just a mom,

right? A busy mom of two, sent him to Florida.

This stuff's not bad, right? So I might come back and use some of

it. Let's see what we have here. My name is Laura.

And just like you, I'm a busy mom trying to juggle everything life throws

at me. I live in Florida with my husband, our two kids.

And for the most of my thirties, I thought I was aging pretty gracefully.

Sure. I had the usual stresses, kids schedules, work deadlines,

trying to keep everyone fed and happy, but I felt better. Good.

I felt young. I felt like me. And then seemingly overnight,

everything changed. It was the morning after my 37th birthday when I caught my

reflection in the bathroom mirror. And I literally froze.

There were lines around my eyes that I swear weren't there the week before.

Deep pronounced crow's feet that made me look like I'd been squinting for years,

but it wasn't just the lines. The skin under my eyes looked different,

loose, crepey, like I'd lost some essential quality that made it look alive.

Like it had lost some essential quality that made it look alive and youthful.

And the dark circles, they made me look like I hadn't slept in months,

even though I'd gone a full eight hours the night before. I stared at

myself in that mirror, and I felt like I was looking at a stranger.

This wasn't the face I knew. This wasn't how I felt inside.

That's when the obsession began. I started with what everyone tries first,

the drugstore cream, CeraVe, Olay, Notre Gina.

I slotted them on religiously morning and night,

convinced that consistency was the key. Nothing.

So I upgraded to the department store counter, Estee Lauder's Miraculous Eye Cream for

$85, Clinique's Proven Formula for $65.

I even splurged on a tiny jar of La Mer eye cream that cost

me $190 and lasted barely a month. Still nothing.

The saleswomen were so convincing. They had charts and studies and before and after

photos. They promised me that their latest breakthrough would be different,

that this time I'd see the results. But month after month,

jar after jar, my reflection stayed the same. If anything,

I was starting to look worse. That's when I got desperate and made an

appointment with a dermatologist. Surely a medical professional would have answers,

right? She recommended prescription retinoids that burned my delicate eye area.

They suggested laser treatment that cost $800 per session and required a few weeks

of downtime. I tried them, the burning and the swelling at the expense,

and for what? Minimal improvement that disappeared within months.

I even considered Botox, but the thought of injecting toxins around my eyes terrified

me. Plus, at $500 every 3-4 months,

it would cost me over $1500 a year just to maintain results that wouldn't

even be addressed. The skin texture and dark circles that bothered me most.

So by this point, I'd spent over $3,000 trying to fix my eye area.

$3,000. That could have been a fanatification for money

towards my kids' college funds. Instead, it was money down the drain with nothing

to show for. But the financial cost wasn't even the worst part.

The worst part was watching myself disappear. I stopped taking photos of my kids

because I hated how I looked. I started avoiding mirrors whenever possible.

I began wearing sunglasses. Glasses and doors just to hide my My husband would

try to reassure me, saying I was being too hard on myself,

but I could see it in his eyes too, a flicker of surprise when

he looked at me, like he was also noticing the changes.

I felt like I was becoming invisible, like the confident,

vibrant woman I had always been was fading away, replaced by someone who looked

tired and old and defeated. That's when I realized that something had to change.

I couldn't keep living like this. Couldn't keep throwing money at products that didn't

work. Couldn't keep watching myself age rapidly while feeling helpless to stop.

I needed real answers, I needed to understand what was actually happening to my

skin, not just get sold another miracle cream by someone who had never experienced

what I was going through. So I started asking around.

I talked to friends, searched online forums, reached out to anyone who might have

insights beyond the standard beauty counter-advice.

And that's when my friend Sarah mentioned Dr. Schilling.

Blurrishly said, if anyone can give you real answers, it's Dr.

Schilling. I'd probably say Dr. Blaine Schilling here. He's been treating aging for over

30 years, and he actually understands the symptoms and science behind what's happening to

your skin. At that point, I was willing to try anything,

so I made the call. Walking in,

let's just keep going. I mean, let me, oh, I'll pause for a minute.

I mean, this is solid, okay? I'll be honest with you,

for a skincare VSL,

using this sort of classic, narrative-driven,

story-based thing might not be the best approach.

Versus, Coming from a doctor or an expert,

more UGC stuff.

Those are things we could add in later. Overall,

for a longer VSL, there's nothing wrong with this,

basically. There's actually little things I could improve that I'll talk about.

But it is not bad.

Like, not bad, it's good. Again,

better than

Every single product from the cheapest drugstore cream to the most expensive department store

miracle is targeting the wrong problem. Wrong problem?

What did he mean? Everyone talks about collagen loss,

he continued, and yes, we do lose collagen as we age,

but that's not what's causing the dramatic changes you're seeing around your eyes.

He put out a diagram, and,

you know, do we like this, maybe, maybe not, and started explaining something I'd

never heard before, something that would completely change how I understood aging.

also going to pause here again. One other thing I'd like to see with

the background story of everything that's going super shitty is reminding them of

the promise, right? Like, promising what,

teasing that she discovered something that's going to solve their pain points and future

pacing it. It'd be good to have that again in here,

and potentially again in here.

Thank you. Okay.

But as we age continued, something far more devastating occurs than just

losing a few threads. Those collagen fibers don't just disappear,

they become loose, tangled, and lose their organized structure.

This breakdown begins at the DEJ, where your skin layers meet,

and spreads throughout what we call the collagen matrix.

Instead of that tight, precise weave, your skin's foundation becomes like fabric that's been

stretched and twisted until the threads are jumbled together.

The way he explained it, I could find no further explanation.

When this organized structure collapses,

Dr. Schilling said, it creates gaps and weaknesses in your skin's foundation.

Structural failures mean the skin's support network

can no longer hold its shape, causing sagging wrinkles.

But it got worse. The dark circles you're seeing?

That's because the weakened structure allows blood vessels to show through where they never

did before. The puffiness that's fluid accumulating in the gaps where organized structure collapses.

Once provided proper drainage. And that loss of firmness,

what you described as your skin losing its snap?

That's because the underlying architecture can no longer bounce back into place.

For the first time in months, everything made sense. This wasn't just about getting

older, this was about a specific identifiable breakdown in my skin's fundamental structure.

And if it could happen, and if it could be identified,

maybe, just maybe, it could be fixed. Dr.

Schilling said, if you know what's causing this, surely there's a must be a

way to fix it. That's what he shared the second part of his revelation.

Okay, so what do I not like? I don't like the revelation,

the maybe just maybe is a little cheesy.

Explains the DEJ well.

Talks about him really listening. Again,

I tie back like a promise of like, hey,

I discovered this crazy thing that changed everything.

But from a classic structure, I have nothing,

no major qualms here. So let's go through this part we're continued on,

right? This

is from Gemini, just to compare. I remember the moment so clearly.

I was getting ready to go out for dinner with my husband and caught

my reflection in the bathroom mirror under that bright, unforgiving light,

and I just stared. The face looking back at me looked exhausted.

There were fine lines fanning out from my eyes that weren't just smile lines

anymore. They were deep-set crow's feet, and under my eyes,

the skin looked thin, almost translucent, with purplish dark circles that made me look

permanently worn out. And so began the frustrating and grueling very expensive journey I'm

sure you all know too well. I started with the drugstore creams that promised

to erase wrinkles in seven days. They did nothing,

so I graduated to the department store counters where I let myself be talked

into buying $200 miracle serums that came in fancy jars but delivered zero miracles.

I even went to a dermatologist who suggested treatments that would cost thousands of

dollars a year with no guarantee. The financial waste was piling up,

but even worse was the emotional toll, the constant disappointment,

the feeling to be in scam. The this is The be in real trigger

event for me was when I realized I was starting to avoid photos.

I ducked behind my kids or offered to be the one to take the

picture. I started to feel invisible like I was

losing that vibrant, confident person I used to be. That was my breaking point.

I knew there had to be a real answer, not just more marketing hype.

I became obsessed with finding the truth and that desperation is what led me

to let me through a friend's concerned referral to Dr.

Blaine Schilling. So let's see how it goes on if you're right.

Blaine Schilling was different. He was a medical doctor of over 30 years of

experience, but he also had a holistic approach looking at the entire picture of

aging. Honestly, I walked into his office expecting another disappointing consultation.

I was ready for him to recommend the same old things I'd already tried,

but I was wrong. He listened patiently as he told me,

as I told him my story, the waste of money, the frustration,

the feeling of looking older than I felt. He nodded and when I was

done, he looked at me and said something that completely floored me. Laura,

he said, it's not your fault that none of these questions worked.

They're all designed to solve the wrong problem. The entire beauty industry is focused

on collagen loss, but that's only a tiny part of the story.

The real issue, the one that causes the rapid aging around the eyes,

is something I call collagen architecture breakdown. He gave me this incredible analogy that

made it all make sense. He said, think of your young, healthy skin like

a piece of high quality fabric with a perfectly tight,

organized weave. Every single collagen thread is in its proper place,

working together to create a smooth, strong, and firm surface.

But as we age, especially in the delicate skin around the eyes,

something far more devastating happens than just losing a few threads.

The entire structure starts to collapse. The threads become loose,

tangled, and jumbled. He explained this breakdown starts at a critical place called the

dermal-epidermal junction, or the DEJ.

It's a place where your top layer of skin meets the deeper layer.

When the architecture there collapses, it creates a chain reaction.

The Skin support network can no longer hold its shape,

causing it to fold and sag, creating wrinkles. The

weakened structure allows a blood vessel to show through the thinning skin, which is

why what we see is dark circles. And fluid begins to accumulate in the

gaps where that organized structure used to provide proper drainage,

leading to puffiness and under-eye bags. It was a total aha moment.

For the first time, I understood why my eyes were aging so fast.

It wasn't just about needing more collagen. It was at the very foundation of

my skin's skin had become a disorganized mess. Pouring more collagen on top of

that mess would be like throwing new threads into a tangled pile of yarn

and expecting it to become a sweater. It just doesn't work. I finally understood

why every other cream had failed me. Let's go on to this part

and then we'll go back to Gemini. Or to Claude. My heart sank a

little because it sounded like a problem that was impossible to fix, but that's

when Dr. Schilling's eyes lit up. He told me that after years of research,

he developed a theoretical framework for reversing this breakdown.

He called it the structural renewal system.

He said the breakthrough isn't to just add more collagen into that broken fabric.

The secret is to command the skin to reorganize and rebuild the architecture it

already has. To take those tangled, messy threads and weave them back into that

tight, strong, youthful structure. He broke it down for me into three simple,

logical steps. Step one is the structural renewal signal.

He explained this requires a specific kind of messenger molecule that can penetrate deep

to the DEJ. This messenger acts like a master weaver,

commanding your skin's own machinery to pull the loose,

tangled collagen threads taut and reorganize them back into their proper,

youthful weave. Once the signal is sent,

the skin needs the right materials to do the job. Or sorry,

step two is the target repair complex. Once the signal is sent,

the skin needs the right materials to do the job. This step provides the

precise amino acids, the exact building blocks for collagen that your skin needs to

rebuild that structure. Not just random proteins,

but the specific, high-quality materials for a strong foundation.

And finally, step three is the integrity locking system.

This was the genius part. This step works to protect your newly restored structure.

It helps inhibit, I would not use inhibit, the very enzymes that were causing

the collagen architecture to break down in the first place. So it doesn't just

rebuild the structure, it locks it in place and protects it from future damage.

It was the most brilliant, logical approach I've ever heard.

It was based on real biology, signal repair lock,

it made perfect sense. I was so excited, I asked him, okay,

so what product do I buy? Where can I get this? And that's when

he gave me the bad news. He smiled kindly and told me that while

the science was clear, no company was actually using this comprehensive approach.

He said the big brands were too invested in their old,

just-added collagen formulas. He had given me the map,

the scientific framework for what would actually work, but he told me I'd have

to find or create the solution myself. So all in all,

actually like this copy a lot. I'm curious what's the use of the product

to build and reveal.

The one thing that's kind of missing is it didn't talk about the ingredients

in that section. So I'm curious.

So while Gemma and I keep going, let's go back to the cloud.

I hope this isn't overwhelming you going from one side to the other,

but I think it's very interesting and worthwhile.

We can take this, we'll take both versions of it and we'll kind of

create a master version that we really like. Okay.

All right. So we go back to this one. Dr.

Schilling leaned back in his chair and smiled. The first helpful expression I've seen

from any medical professional regarding my eye concerns.

Right? I think this is too much narrative and the writing is not as

good here. Laura,

here's the breakdown that changes everything. If the problem is college and architecture,

we're to break down and the solution isn't that more college into broken fabric.

The solution is to restore the organized structure of the weave himself. He started

drawing diagrams, explaining what he called the structural renewal system.

Think of it this way. He said, instead of just dumping more threads onto

a tangled mess of fabric, what we need to do is pull those loose

tingle fibers taught and reorganize them back into the proper weave pattern.

The science behind it was fascinating. Dr. Schilling explained that the structural renewal system

works in three precise steps. What I really want to see,

When does it bring up the ingredients? I'm gonna skim for a second.

Okay, interesting. So it's doing it here. Give

me one minute. Step one

is what

I call the structural renewal signal.

You need specific compounds that can penetrate deep to where the breakdown is occurring

and essentially command your skin's machinery to pre-organize the collagen architecture.

These compounds act like a master weaver. Telling the loose tangled collagen fibers to

pull tight and arrange themselves back into a proper structure.

Step two is the targeted repair complex.

While the renewal signal is reorganizing existing structure,

you also need precise building blocks, specific amino acids,

that provide exactly what your skin needs to rebuild and strengthen that organized matrix.

Not just any proteins or amino acids you emphasize, but the exact materials your

skin uses to create strong,

properly structured collagen.

And step three is the integrity locking system. Once you've restored the proper architecture,

you need to protect it from enzymes that cause the breakdowns in the first

place. These are called matrix meloproteinases,

MMPs for short, and they're essentially little scissors that cut up your collagen structure.

If you don't control them, all your renewal work gets undone. So if you

remember, we looked at Gemini. It did, it had enzymes,

but it did not call these out. And I really liked the little scissors

analogy. So this is where I'm going to pick and choose from two different

brands. I was taking notes as fast as I could,

but then I asked the obvious question. Dr. Schilling,

this all makes perfect sense. So which eye cream should I be using?

Which product actually does all this? The expression grew serious.

Laura, that's the problem. My 30 years of practice,

I'm noticing a single eye cream that addresses collagen architecture breakdown at the DEJ

level. Every product on the market, even the most expensive ones,

is still stuck on the old paradigm of just adding moisture or trying to

boost collagen production. They're all missing the critical part.

Peace, reorganizing the existing structure and protecting it from future breakdown.

My heart sank. Here was finally someone who understood the real problem,

who had a solution that made scientific sense, and yet there was no product

that actually implemented his approach. So what am I supposed to do?

I asked. Well, Dr. Schilling said thoughtfully,

you could wait for the cosmetic industry to catch up with the science,

but given how slowly they move and how profitable their current approach is for

them, that could take decades. Or he continued,

you could take what I've just taught, you and find a way to create

the solution yourself. That conversation changed my life.

I walked out of Dr. Schilling's office with knowledge that no one had ever

shared with me before, but also with the daunting realization that if I wanted

to solve my problem, I was going to have to do it myself. But

at least now I knew exactly what I was looking for.

Okay, product build and reveal.

Let's do it with Quad first, and we'll go look in Gemini.

Armative.com Dr. Schilling's insights about collagen architecture breakdown and the structural renewal system I

went on a mission. I researched every eye cream on the market with new

eyes, looking specifically for products that address the DEJ,

that contain compounds capable of reorganizing collagen structure,

that include MMP inhibitors to protect against future breakdown.

And guess what I found? Nothing. Absolutely nothing.

Product after product claimed to boost collagen, but none addressed the architectural breakdown that

was the real problem. They were all still stuck on surface level solutions,

adding moisture, providing temporary plumping,

or using basic peptides that couldn't penetrate to where the real damage was occurring.

Even the most expensive, scientifically formulated creams were missing the mark entirely.

I started reaching out to cosmetic chemists, asking if they could formulate something based

on Dr. Schilling's specifications. Most of them had never even heard of the DEJ,

let alone understood the importance of collagen architecture.

It was incredibly frustrating. Here I had the roadmap to the solution,

but no one seemed capable of creating it. That's when my husband suggested we

try to develop it ourselves. Laura, he said,

you understand the science now better than any, than most cosmetic companies do.

You know exactly what needs to be done. Why don't we find the right

people and create the product Dr. Schilling described? It seemed impossible at first.

How could two regular people with no background in cosmetic formulation compete with massive

companies that have been doing this for decades? But then I realized something.

Those massive companies weren't trying to solve the real problem. They were making money

selling temporary fixes and false hope. They had no incentive to create something that

actually worked. We, on the other hand,

had every incentive in the world. I needed the solution to work,

not just for me, but for my confidence, my self-esteem,

my ability to feel like myself again. So we started the process.

First, we had to find the right ingredients, not just any collagen boosting compounds,

but specifically those that could single structural renewal at the DEJ level.

Discover a dipolymer. It's a special peptide that has been shown

in clinical studies to reduce wrinkles by 32% and increase skin firmness by 14%,

but more importantly, it was one of the few compounds proven to stimulate the

production of TI-MPS, the proteins that inhibit those collagen-destroying MMPs

Dr. Schilling had warned us about. Then we found pistachio lenticest extract

derived from mastic trees. Research showed it can increase the density of sporine fiber

by 5% the upper dermis by 51% while decreasing the weakened dermal layer by

29%. This is exactly what we needed for step 2 of the structural removal

system. But finding the right ingredients was only the beginning.

We had to determine the exact concentrations, the optimal delivery system,

the perfect pH levels to ensure these compounds would actually penetrate to the DEJ

where they were needed. Okay.

There were so many setbacks. Our first formulations were or too thick.

We couldn't absorb properly. Then we made them too thin and they didn't deliver

enough active ingredients. We struggled with stability preservation with creating something gentle enough for

the delicate eye area, but powerful enough to create real change.

Month after month, we tested and refined, tested and refined.

I was starting to wonder if we'd been off more than we could chew.

And then finally we had our breakthrough. The formulation team called me with excitement

in their voices. Laura, we think we got it.

This formula has every mark marker Dr.

Schilling specified. So we're done. The penetration studies are incredible.

The stability testing is perfect and the initial user trials are showing results we've

just never seen before. I was almost afraid to hope when I tried the

final formula for myself, I knew within the first week that something was different.

My eye area felt different, more supple, more hydrated,

but in a way that seemed to come from deep within the skin rather

than just on the surface. By week three, I could see visible changes.

The fine lines that had been etched around my eyes were softening.

The dark circles were lightening. My skin was starting to breathe. Regained that firmness

I'd lost, but the real test came at week six when I ran into

an old friend at the grocery store. Laura, she exclaimed,

you look amazing. What have you been doing? You look so rested and young.

That's when I knew we had created something special. I immediately sent photos and

detailed notes to Dr. Schilling and his response was everything I'd hoped for.

Laura, this is exactly what I was hoping someone would create.

You've taken the theoretical framework of the structural neural system and turned it into

a practical, effective solution. I'm genuinely impressed with what Flavio the science and the

results. Word spread quickly among friends and family.

Everyone wants to know my secret, wanted to try this miracle product I created,

but it wasn't a miracle. It was science. It was understanding the real problem

and creating a real solution. And that's how UDI serum,

UDI revised serum was born. All right.

So this one is interesting,

right? We got to the structure. We introduced two ingredients.

Now we're gonna do the close and the close,

I was kind of thinking about the other ingredients, and it does have these

ones here, right? So the

one thing I think it's missing would be the specific,

uh,

amino acids. So I'd probably tell it to do that.

I'm gonna tell you right now, the close is probably gonna be overall fine.

We'll go ahead through it, because we're gonna combine these together. I'm not gonna

read the whole close right now, because the close should be pretty formulaic,

based on the reference points that Cloud Projects

had. Gemini, I don't know as much about, because we didn't give it a

reference VSL are closed.

So let's see. What

I'm

skimming about, All

right, while let's continue, let's look at this part too.

Okay, I'm not gonna go so long in every VSL example necessarily,

but this is important.

So my quest began. Armed with Dr. Schilling's incredible insights,

I felt like I had a secret map to a hidden treasure.

It wasn't just another, I wasn't just looking for another acronym anymore.

I was looking for a formula that specifically addressed college and architecture breakdown at

the DEJ. I was searching for that three-step system,

signal, repair, and lock. Okay,

I spent weeks and months diving in, reading studies.

What I found is what he had predicted. Things were missing,

all this stuff, whatever. I was at a crossroads.

I am summarizing because I want to,

get to that part right.

Um, I talked to my husband.

We decided, since it didn't exist, we're going to create it.

We started our own skincare company, Opal Beauty. We have a single guy mission

to create a formula based on Dr. Schilling's scientific framework that could deliver real

transformative results for a woman like me. But it wasn't easy.

We had to find a good lab. Most

importantly, we made proven, most potent clinically proven ingredients,

like specific peptides. Getting the right concentrations was a huge issue.

Went through dozens of iterations. We obsessed.

We finally created a serum. Took it to Dr.

Schilling. It looked good.

And the proof was in the mirror, right? I was seeing this transformation.

Soon I started noticing I mean. We had

something special. That's how this long journey of frustration

and discovery led to, you know, UD iRevive serum being born.

So keep in mind, and this may have been the brief skipping it.

for

both of them. Hey, make sure you do figure out these ones,

right? So,

overall

looks pretty good though. We'd have to add that in.

Emphasizes

the clean formula, which I like. What's

cool is even though it doesn't have the examples, it's really following the structure

pretty closely. I'm

gonna let this go for a minute. I suppose my headphones are,

like, on the side of my head like this. Alright,

so I have it right in the close. Call to action.

It's about fake Qs.

Alright,

so.

Now we have two full drafts.

What are we gonna do here? By the way, Claude,

to his credit, basically wrote the entire thing.

8500 words.

And that was just one take.

So,

pretty impressive.

One second here.

Okay, cool. I'm gonna stop here.

And I'm gonna do a new video for Part 3.

It should be the final part. Which is where we're gonna take all of

this and we're gonna turn it into like an actual VSL.

It might be a fourth Part 2, actually. Part 3 is gonna be the

whole VSL. And then Part 4 is we're gonna look at some different leads

and angles and things like that that we can test as well.

So,

yeah, pause it a minute. And I guess the other thing to keep in

mind is, again, while this might not be the right

format for an ISERM,

it could work for a ClickBank type of VSL,

right? Maybe it's not the best type for meta, but frankly,

I would probably shoot for a shorter video ad normally on meta.

Or I might swipe MiamiMD, or Nuro,

or other things like that. The hard thing these days,

one of the reasons why longform doesn't make sense is because you need to

test so many variants. And I can show you what I mean later,

but, uhm, when we get to meta ads and stuff.

But either way, I think this is good for showing you this process.

So I'm going to stop here. With this one,

we'll come back for part three.
