Alright, let's get our quad project 4.

Doing, I should make this bigger, uh,

emo sequences, okay? Should be pretty helpful. And do it here.

This is why I waste my time. Look,

basic instructions, okay? Your job is to create various emo sequences for different products

and services that will range from econ products to coaching or information products.

I mean, do this, like, it doesn't matter. This, I have it,

it's fine. You have several documents in your knowledge base that should provide all

the examples you need to write great sequences. You'll see that there are several

examples for abandoned car emails, welcome emo series for new customers,

special sales and promotion series, flash sales, reorder series, for getting a customer to

order more of a product prior to running out,

win back series, uhm, so basically everything we went through

in the previous part of this, you know,

in the email series section you looked at.

You'll also notice that some of the sequences focus more heavily on discounting,

while some focus more on emotion. What will happen is that I will give

you instructions about the kind of email sequence I'm looking to have written,

as well as the product or service or brand we are running the sequence

for. You'll then select from relevant examples,

synthesizing across several of them when necessary to create a new sequence.

Okay? Cool.

Looks like I did it here. All right, so.

Let's kind of go back into the wild, right? UDI Serum.

What should we do? Let's do a,

Uh,

to start,

let's do a 7-day abandoned cart

sequence for UDI.

UDI Serum. Uh,

let's focus on,

I ain't gonna do much today. Let's, uhm,

introduce a 20%

off discount on

day. Day 3.

Increase it to a 40% off discount

on day 5. Uh,

so days 5 through 7.

Can you please outline this sequence for

me. Uh,

then after I approve, I'll have you write it.

So I'll save this prompt,

that's what this prompt is like.

Sorry, didn't include the link.

So I'm gonna just do this, I'm gonna start over again.

So, like, you're knowledge base. Looks

pretty good.

And write it, I'm just gonna write one note for the tone.

Female, one, and then general.

Make sure it is empathetic,

supportive. Be still.

Painful. We want to do it more like,

you've experienced this,

or some of our customers share

that. To

do is sound like we're assuming

things about the prospect.

Some of our customers who share that they feel hesita- uhm,

or maybe like some of our customers who feel- share that they feel hesitant

to invest in themselves because they've been disappointed before.

I completely understand these feelings. What I can tell you is that UDI certainly

works differently than anything you've likely tried before.

Uhm, kind of explains the science of it,

testimonials, you deserve to feel confident,

you deserve the rightness, it's waiting to complete your order,

here's the guarantee, or you're protected. Okay,

why your eyes- might age faster. There's no reason other items don't work.

So we're gonna educate them a bit, here's why ours works better,

cool. 20% off.

20%

off, here's a, you know, terms of our stock.

Objection handling.

Increases kind of urgency. So I mean, you can play with the results,

but like, it's still right, it's pretty cool, right? Alright.

Nice,

right? I'm

gonna copy it. And I'm gonna save this one,

let's see. Alright,

so I saved the emails, you can look through them. They seem pretty solid.

Which is pretty cool. As well they should.

Cool,

right? So. What

else can we do? Give me a second to prepare this and I'll show

you. Alright, so let me show you what I'm doing here, okay? I'm gonna

say, now let's do a new customer welcome sequence for UDI Serum.

Let's have it be 10 emails. In email number 3,

let's introduce our opaline rich cream as a great compliment to UDI Serum.

Give the customer a 20% off coupon code,

they can use it while ordering it. In email number 7, let's introduce our

citric whipped aloe and also offer a 20% off.

In email number 10, let's give them a 20% off store wide coupon.

Provide an outline, once I approve it,

you'll do it, right? So, in this case,

because it's a quad project,

I don't need to, uhm,

I don't need to share the UDI link again.

So,

that's the link for opaline. Here's

the link for sacred. Oh my god,

I keep getting the wrong thing, sorry about that.

Finally,

let's do store wide.

So, again, So let's run this prompt and

see what we get. Alright,

welcome, celebration,

what to expect, good positioning,

expectations, join community saving before tracking.

We don't have a community, but I'll just keep it for now. You know,

your ice cream has shipped.

I think, what are we checking,

I think these are timelines that are a little too fast. I'm going to

have to give feedback here, it's just fine, okay? Uhm,

let's move email to,

to, what's this,

for email to,

for, let's say,

you know, should you can assume,

okay, for email three,

make the code. Pitch

20,

just because, this is not confusing, probably.

For email four, it seems like going

day five, a one-week check-in.

Doesn't make sense, it's too early.

Let's

move that to email five,

day ten, and move emails back

correspondingly. Let's also

do a new email four.

That comes out

on day five. Please provide suggestions.

I think I like D. I

like this for a shot. I think we should do an email one. I

think I like option. D the most for email

four. Let's go ahead and write this sequence,

please. So what I want you to be seeing here is like,

Some of everything else, like, you kind of are the commander,

but you're more like a strategist than actually writing the copy,

right? Like,

And so you might look at this and say, well, I want them to

be like every single day. You just tell Claude, hey,

I want this to be every single day, Uhm.

So it's really like as simple as that.

I'll say, I'll share this conversation history. So you can see that the revisions,

you know, day one, welcome instant gratification,

a gratitude. My family,

I want to personally welcome you to what I believe will be one of

the most transformative skin care journeys you've ever experienced.

You just made a beautiful choice, not just for yourself,

but your skin, but for yourself. And this is by

the way, this is not weird. Like Opal's thing Skin care.

We're sort of very subtle with it. Uhm,

but this is actually all good. I mean, the heart emoji thing is weird

why it's gray. We'll want to do different emojis probably.

So this is you made, so it's like really reaffirming their thing,

right? Cleanse

their face gently, right, tell them what to do, even the application,

pro tips. I mean,

I don't know if you should say less is more. It's fine,

but I don't know if you really need it. Perfect

partner. How to amplify your results.

I guess this is going on day 3, I don't know if they would

have it yet, so I would

modify this copy. But again,

it's not that the copy's bad, it's literally just being consistent and logical.

I'm not sure why, it's being worth these hearts right now, right? Uhm,

okay,

go forward

to day 5, I'm going to give you the spotlight.

Right, Good to think of it,

it's kind of reminding them how great the formula is that they bought.

Get your one week check in,

here's what people notice, you're not seeing dramatic changes,

don't worry, it's normal, it has a good sign,

you know, it is great. What happened,

what's happening to your skin right now, you're way too focused,

right? to these things. So

it's kind of good consumption, right? Talking

about this 20 day cycle, here's these great things that are happening.

You know, it's giving homework, we don't have to do that, but I don't

hate it honestly. Customer success spotlight,

so anyway, it's pretty good overall, right? It's pretty cool. So,

let me save that as well. I'll do, like,

uh,

new document, uh, Unity welcome series.

It's cool,

right? So now it's

saying,

okay, awesome job.

Um, now I want to do a

three-day sale for 4th of July for

Opal Beauty.

Let's make it,

uh, let's,

sorry, why? If they can save 30%,

please provide an outline.

Depends on your skin concern, it's just sort of mediocre.

Okay,

great,

uhm, let's Thanks,

but let's do three emails on day

three. I know this is already the 4th of July,

but like, Day three.

I don't know how else to tell it.

Uhm.

So, what I'm

gonna say is,

like,

uhm,

get about

our other two SKUs as well.

And

if I had taught it,

I could have just told that in advance, right? Okay,

great.

Go ahead. Write it,

please. You

have to format it. I don't know why Claude is really being so bizarre

with the, uh, The, uhm, I mean the formatting

and also the emojis.

You need to update pricing. Pricing is off on this.

That's good,

right? Like why, you know,

true freedom comes from these things, right? So

there might be little things you want to, like, modify, but overall,

it should give you a pretty good place. And you saw,

like, these samples, you should be thinking like a copywriter, marker,

and thinking back to, like, what you're accomplishing. Yeah,

should be pretty solid overall. And it's cool,

like I said, you can do this with, uh,

you know, I used Opal, but I'm trying to think of,

like, I mean,

I don't know, I don't feel like I need to beat you over the

head with examples, but, like, you know,

you saw the other examples for, like, coaching,

info products, whatever it is, I mean, yeah,

you can do it for, like, really whatever. So,

uh,

yeah, there you go. So this project should be, should have fun,

should really help you a lot. Make life a lot easier,

uhm,

you just gotta, you know, just tell it what you want and give it

feedback. Like, that's really the secret, you know?

Oh, and by the way, what if I don't have a website,

you know, like, I mean, fine, one more thing I want to show you

real quick, uhm,

I'm doing a new call, I think, right? like I'm trying

to think of one of our examples, oh my gosh, that seduction thing,

when I tried to show this person to one time Like,

it literally was not, like, this is some old-ass thing from forever ago.

I swear to God I don't, I'm not doing anything in the seduction space,

it's so annoying What

I'm thinking about is, like, what's a brief that we didn't use

yet, like, financial? Financial is tricky,

but we can test it We

did, you know, Unity I don't think we have,

we have the one blood sugar thing in there. I'm trying to think of

a thing I could do where it's, like, not I

don't want to basically skew the data because it's already got a blood sugar

thing in. Oh, what the hell, let's go with,

uh If

I have a sales letter, That's what I should have done Well,

that's fine, you can do a brief R sales letter, uh, for a financial,

uh, newsletter product Please review,

and then come up with a 7 email abandoned cart sequence

Outline once approved,

I'll have you write the sequence Try

to bury this, be far more supportive of this nightmare Cure evolution,

know where you'll profit from Restate the core hook,

create urgency While you hesitate,

billionaires double down Your

$49 charter membership expires tomorrow

That's good, yo, one thing I might do is be like, you know,

offer them an extra 25% off

starting on day 5

Yes, this looks good. Go ahead and write it,

Okay, just to see. And again, I could upload a sales letter.

I could do whatever. You know, I could link it to any website.

I could, like, you know,

like hotdogs.com or whatever.

Uhm, so,

it's pretty powerful and pretty versatile. But,

you know.

This is going to be kind of, you know, this is going to be

kind of conspiratorial and whatever. This is going to match the style of the

brief, right? So,

anyway, this is pretty dope. And it already looks really good. I'll save this

so you have access to that as well. And you have the cloud project,

so you can create plenty yourself.

And then you'll have the PDFs of all the sequences. This is in here

too. Not received. Alright, thanks.
