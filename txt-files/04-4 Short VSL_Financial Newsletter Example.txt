Alright,

so, we're gonna do some short VSL examples real quick here.

But what I wanted to do first was show you how

I want to generate hooks. Here's the big difference,

okay? Uhm,

it's the same kind of hook prompt, and I'll link you to this conversation,

for a financial newsletter, targeting people who are mostly problem-aware and solution-aware.

We didn't do a research on this, but ultimately,

yeah, they're problem-aware about their investment stuff,

they're solution-aware, they know newsletters and investment things,

different investment options exist. Uhm, I'll update the sentiment thing here a little bit,

investing in healthcare, etc.

This is what's different with this one, I said I uploaded a copy of

the script, your which I was not to only come up with hooks from

the script, rather, I used to find tons of different hooks that create curiosity

and keep people glued to a shorter video ad that gets people to click

a link and go watch the full video presentation. I don't normally do it

this way, but I did here. And the reason why is because when you

have a really strong, big idea about, like,

a genetic royalty type of thing, like,

I think it's a little bit different, like, if you had blood sugar it

probably isn't it isn't I guess because it's just like on one hand you're

like, hey, stop doing, uh,

this, like, here's a mistake, investment mistake.

But I think, like, there's also a lot of, like, we probably want more

congruency like,

in a health offer, you can sort of, like, educate them about X, like,

coffee, right? Oh, hey, don't drink coffee until you watch this.

Coffee actually spikes cortisol,

which makes you have high blood sugar, but there's a Himalayan spice hack that

fixes it. Go here. Right. And I guess you could essentially use that same

structure for a financial ad, but I also don't

mind some of the specific hooks being around Jack Realty.

So I want to see what happens. So let's look here. If it's good,

I'll make that document one. Let's see. So

I'll have a big pharma focus,

which I don't think makes a ton of sense.

The FDA policy to strangle medical innovation for decades just got reversed.

That's interesting. This is good.

This former big pharma insider walked away from his seven-figure salary to expose this.

But probably, probably,

I said probably to expose this, you know,

probably not compliant, but like once-in-a-lifetime investment opportunity,

right? Expose this once,

uh, once-in-a-generation,

This market-making investment opportunity or something,

investment, you know, this market-making, uh,

I don't know, I'll think of a different word for it, but yeah. I'm

gonna say, thanks, these are okay.

The one thing is, we really are focused on VA

and, like, diseases.

That, I think we want them to be more focused on

the investment opportunity.

As well,

not about some new gear,

but how technology changes

in healthcare, or this FDA decision,

or whatever else, uhm,

are creating a once-in-a-generation

opportunity. I'm gonna do these. Honestly,

if the hooks don't get better, uhm,

then, we can still just do the short one without them,

but let's just see. And while we're waiting to see, I,

I really think, I don't know if I'll sound like a,

I'm being a dead horse, or whatever the expression is you want to use.

Like, part valuable thing of this entire course shouldn't just be,

like, the outputs, but it should be, like,

how I just very quickly correct.

How long does it say? Yeah, you know, thanks, but this is where you're

off. Like, it really is,

like, working together. It does amazing thing sometimes,

but you're still sort of the conductor,

right? So let's see,

Honestly, these seem okay, Like,

this one's okay,

but I'd rather just see what Cloud comes up with first.

So, we'll just see, right?

Let's go. How do I want to approach it?

Thumb up the script, or they're breaking up. In this case,

I want to do VSLs for the script, right?

So, like, here's the, here's a script for a financial.

So right

now I want to write a

series of two-minute long VSL

ads that sell the click or something someone,

uh,

the goal being someone watches,

hooked, and the call to

action is to go watch the full presentation.

Please give me ten short two-minute VSL

concepts right now. What I'm curious about,

again, is going to be the hooks for these, right?

Four trillion dollar secret, big pharma has been hiding a four trillion dollar secret

for over a hundred years.

This is too aggressive, cure conspiracy.

Pure Etheal just invested two million dollars in saying it terrifies big pharma,

it's kind of good.

The FDA just made an announcement that could destroy big pharma's business model,

it's pretty good. This is kind of interesting,

forget buying individual

biotech stocks.

There's a much smarter way to profit from gene therapy,

so I think there's

some good ones here. So I would probably go with,

like,

you know, let's start with Concept for

three weeks. And

again, you know, some of these hooks are good,

but like, what about the hooks from Perplexity? It's like, well,

play around with it. Experiment with Perplexity,

Deep Research, other places, you've got the whole training on that.

Peter

Thiel just invested $2 million dollars in the same thing that has big pharma

executives losing sleep at night. Mark Cuban has quietly poured millions into the same

opportunity. If you're wondering why some of the world's smartest investors are suddenly panicking

to get into this space, you're about to find out. See,

for over 100 years, big pharma has built their empire on a simple business

model, keep you sick in pain. Cancer drugs that cost $100,000 and only extend

life by 3 months. Diabetes medications you take for life.

Arthritis treatments that manage pain but never actually heal your joints.

But there's something you never want to do to discover. Actual cures,

uhm,

well, you've heard of them, you know, big pharma's trillion dollar system,

symptom management business would be destroyed.

What's got billionaires scrambling?

The FDA just announced new fast-track approval pathways

for gene therapy. So this isn't bad.

I don't honestly, what do I want? How do I get,

how do I make these good? Let's make it more teasing. Opportunity.

Teasing

genetic. Loyalties.

FDA decision. Etc.

Let's not hate

so much. I guess I'll just teasing.

What happened?

And the opportunity.

The consequences.

That's good.

Let's see what happens when we do that. Let's find out. I like that

a lot more already,

right? The genetic royalties hook is just so good.

Might Let's

see what happens when we

do that.

Here's

the

crazy part, billionaires like Thiel actually have a disadvantage in this opportunity.

One of his companies is so small, if he invested seriously,

he'd own the whole thing. But for regular investors,

a small stake could turn into generational wealth. The problem is,

once Wall Street figures this out, it'll be too late. And if you own

the wrong pharmaceutical stock when this hits, you could watch your retirement savings get

wiped out. They put together an emergency presentation that goes exactly what the FDA

announced, which three companies are positioned to pay profit and which big pharma stocks

you need to dump immediately, but I don't know I can keep this online,

click below to watch it now. So that's pretty good. I like that more.

Okay, great. I liked that a lot more.

Now let's write another one with a hook about,

don't buy any big pharma stocks until

you to hear this. All right,

let's go with that hook while watching.

Don't buy big pharma stocks until you see this. In fact,

if you own Johnson and Johnson, Pfizer and Merck right now,

we're about to share so you can save your portfolio from complete devastation.

Three days ago, former Big Pharma insider. I sent me a leaked internal memo

when revealed about the features coming to shock me.

So you're saying happening inside behind closed doors that could make the entire business

model obsolete overnight. Most investors have absolutely no idea it's coming.

It all started for recent FDA decision that has been kept incredibly quiet.

This wasn't some minor policy tweak. This was a complete reversal of how they've

operated for the past century. It's about to trigger what I'm calling the great

pharma collapse. Now here's what's interesting.

It's a good phrase. It's interesting for investors. Bye-bye.

Big pharma stocks could lose 50, 70, even 8% of value.

There are three tank companies positioned to capture all that market share though.

The past is something I call a genetic Royal streams,

royalty streams and as old farm school giants crumble,

these companies could start collecting massive payments on every breakthrough treatment that gets developed.

Then it started to leak this memo says we would have maybe six months

before this hits the mainstream, maybe less.

Once Wall Street catches on the pharma self could be swift and brutal and

three companies positioned to profit their stock prices could go explode overnight,

but everything I know into an urgent presentation, including the leaked memo of the

three company names and exactly which big pharma stocks to dump immediately.

Click below and watch it now before your portfolio becomes collateral damage.

This might be the most important financial decision you make this year.

All right. Way better. Super cool. Um,

like watch, like,

okay, cool.

Do one with a,

who's cast your voiceover and it starts,

um, they're called genetic royalties. I noticed a few minutes

ago, they're called genetic

royalties and they could,

you know, They could upend the,

The call to check royalties and it could upend the multi-trillion dollar pharmaceutical industry

before this year is over. This is a developing story that mainstream financial media

isn't covering yet, but according to leaked documents we've obtained,

a recent FDA policy reversal has just triggered what insiders are calling the patent

wars, and it could reshape who controls American medicine forever.

For over a century, Big Pharma has maintained their stranglehold on healthcare through one

simple strategy, suppress the cures, sell the treatments.

But three small biotech companies have been quietly accumulating the foundational power.

The patents that every future cure will need to license.

These aren't your typical biotech gambles, they are what industry experts are now calling

genetic royalty platforms. The catalyst?

A bombshell FDA announcement three weeks ago that most investors completely missed.

Again, the three weeks I'd probably do like recent vs.

three weeks. This single policy change just broke the regulatory barriers that have protected

Big Pharma for decades and according to our sources, gene therapy approvals are about

to excite from a trickle to a flood. Every single one will need to

pay licenses. The fees to these three platform companies,

the implications are staggering. Well, pharmaceutical giants like Pfizer and Johnson and Johnson could

see their stock prices collapse as their business model comes obsolete.

These two companies could start collecting royalty payments on every breakthrough cure that gets

developed. When industry analysts told us off the record,

this could be the biggest wealth transfer in medical history. I love that,

but here's the problem. Once the story breaks in the mainstream financial media,

it'll be too late to get in at current prices.

Our investigation suggests we may have weeks,

not months, before Wall Street catches on. We've compiled everything we know into a

special investigative report, including the three company ticker symbols,

blah blah, right? Again,

I'm sure there's some compliance issues with it, but it's pretty good.

Uhm, sorry, that's not what I wanted.

I wanted to do, What

was it? And

now, let's do one with hookaround.

Alright,

this will be the last one,

then I'll stop and I'll share the document with you all. But you can

see how we can start riffing and going even without perplexity,

right? This will be the biggest wealth transfer in medical history,

and it's happening right under Wall Street's nose. While everyone's distracted by AI stocks

and crypto, a seismic shift is about to rip through the pharmaceutical industry.

For a hundred years, blue pharma has hoarded trillions of profits by keeping you

sick and dependent on their treatments, but that stranglehold is about to be broken.

A recently updated decision has just unleashed technology that could make their entire business

model obsolete. And the company's positioned to capture that wealth,

they're trading for pennies on the See,

they're tiny. Three tiny biotech companies.

Everybody feels alone. Licensing fee.

I'm not gonna read the whole thing. You can see the rest of it.

Pretty cool, right? Pretty good. Um,

so sweet. So yeah, so I'll show you this example with financial stocks,

and, uh,

that concludes our short BSL section for financial.

It also actually concludes,

I

think the BSL section, from my perspective of recording,

I'm gonna do, like, a post, like,

watch this that ties it all together. But it won't just be about BSLs,

it'll be everything up to here, and then also,

you know, do an overview video at the beginning.

But I think this ties this section up,

so. All right,

thank you so much. See you as we explore.

Well, that tying it all together section,

and then advertorials, product pages,

ads, everything else.

All right, bye-bye.
