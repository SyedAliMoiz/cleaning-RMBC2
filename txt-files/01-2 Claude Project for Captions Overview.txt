Alright, so this is going to be a pretty fast one.

Like I mentioned in the end of the last video, it's just a cloud

project for, you know,

creating captions for ads. So all I did was take really simple,

I'm going to give you some examples of meta ad captions in your knowledge

base. You'll use these as another knowledge you have about meta ad captions to

try and do ad captions based on instructions on your chat interface.

So I put that on a cloud project, uploaded some caverns.

So, captions, which is, uh,

you'll have, uh, in here as well. It's just some,

it's like, honestly, can you just have Gemini and other places write captions?

They're going to be fine. And,

you know, I don't use this personally, but I'm,

let's test it out, right? Uh,

can you do some ad captions for community iSerum?

It just depends, like, I think, like, the ad captions are important,

but they're not crazy, um, uh, like, what am I going to say, uh,

uhm? benefits

plus a CDA to save,

57% off. And then

I can run my link, save, here we,

Oh my god.

There's that,

here's here. You know,

the big thing here is if you had some hooks, you might,

you would want to add those to the captions, right? But let's just see

what this does here. Okay. Caption 1, 54,

I thought my eye bags were permanent,

tried everything,

and they worked. The real problem wasn't what I thought,

it wasn't dryness or aging, it was having them inside my skull.

Skin layers, DEJ, so I found the Ayurvedic serum,

this would obviously be formatted. Great.

I mean,

I'll share the outputs here, I'm still writing some.

But.

Great, thank you, now can you do some really short

ones that are just a few lines and sell the click people to

go learn more about community.

Come

on,

little cloud, you can do it. I

don't know why Claude's struggling here. I'll pause it for a minute.

Okay, it's working on it. To

do it? Okay, add them to this,

okay. At 54,

people think I had work done, but it's just a skinny, affine serum that

penetrates deeper than any acne I've tried.

Clinical studies show 45% recovery reduction in 60 days.

C, breakthrough science. While your

expensive eye creams aren't working, neutrinos surface while a real agent happens to sleep
inside your skin layers. This doctor-endorsed serum changes everything.

Discover here. Right? Uhm.

That's really all you need for captions, to be honest with you.

And you'll just test a bunch of stuff. There's like no other way to

do this besides, like, testing.

So You have the caption,

you've got this. Take it over for whatever you want,

like. Look at this guy,

like.

Getting people to this website and sign up

for masterclass.

I think if I give it some hooks, we can probably make them a

little bit more dialed in. But,

easy peasy, lemon squeezy.

All right, thank you. Goodbye.
