Alright, so in this module,

we're going to be talking about setting up clod projects for different VSLs.

And, well, in this module, this video.

Um, this actually will be a very fast video,

because it is pretty simple.

Um, if you're at this point here,

hopefully you watched the brief section. It's really important that you did,

if you're doing VSLs especially. So,

let's really all we're doing in here is we're

setting up projects for long form,

medium form, 3-7 minute length ones,

and then short ones. Now, for 3-7 minute and

short, like, those are almost always going to be,

honestly, the same thing as, like, video ads. The

difference between short and 3-7 minutes is really,

like, short are almost all,

like, 1-2 minutes long, and by almost all,

what do I mean? I mean, basically put in a bunch of short ad

transcripts that we're going to give to cloud projects,

you could always add more if you wanted to, whatever,

right? Uhm,

whereas, The

three to seven minute ones are, I have 8 of them in here,

sorry, that's the teaser, uhm,

and they actually range in time from,

you know, a little over 3 minutes up to about 7 minutes,

hence 3-7 minutes, the newer one,

newer one in here is 7 minutes long. Uhm,

one interesting thing I did, and I only did it on this one,

is I put the length of each ad,

here, I know this is small, but it's like 3 to 30,

3 minutes and 30 seconds, uh,

like where I say like the newer one is 6 minutes and 54

seconds, the reason I did that is because I'm wondering,

you know, if Claude,

telling it how long these transcripts are gives it frame of reference when I

tell Claude to write new VSL.

And when I talk about it, like I wonder,

it's because I, to be honest with you,

I had, I used Claude projects,

I used all these processes I'm teaching, but as I made RBC2, I've also

been improving my processes a lot,

and frankly, making them way better, which is super cool.

So like even the brief thing, to be honest with you, I did it

differently up until RBC2, and then I'm like,

oh shit, like this is the way to do it. Like I've been doing

it all the way,

but it's not as good as this brief, and it's super cool.

So I'm like, I'm grateful that I've made this course because it's like,

help me make my processes even better.

And then you're getting them cutting edge, hot off the press,

all of that. Uh,

same thing with like this. I had projects for some different length VSLs and,

you know, ads and things, but this is,

uh, I didn't have one specifically.

Specifically for three to seven minutes. Now I do, and I gave it the

time. So really it's like the same setup for all of these things,

um, in each of the folders,

sorry, just to make one more important point. I could have actually stuck with

that one. You'll get the instructions for the cloud project,

like this much bigger.

So this one's actually a little bit longer. Yeah,

but your job is to generate many video sales letters that are typically three

to seven minutes long. This document, or the documents in your knowledge base includes

transcripts from several of these VSLs, which we can model off of while writing

new VSLs. What you'll want to do is analyze the structure of the various

VSL examples and then synthesize that knowledge and use that same knowledge along with

your judgment to produce the new VSLs. Please note that most of the time

VSLs of this length are run as in-feed,

out ads, a meta. Also,

they often do not reveal the product they're selling and instead tease a new

solution or breakthrough, with the call to action being to go watch a video

or read a report to get information. That being said,

at other times they may mention the product and mention how people can get

a discount. I'll typically specify the goal when asking you to write VSL scripts.

In general, when you go to write, I'll give you various inputs or even

an outline and a game plan, and you'll be able to model off of

the examples based on the information about whatever the current short VSL project is.

One important note, please don't try to rush or condense anything.

Instead, whenever you run out of space, just prompt me and I'll tell you

to continue. This one is not that relevant for anything below,

like, a 20-minute long script because Claw just has really long outputs now in

general, but I still like having it in here. It's no big deal.

Okay, so that's an example. And you've got your next transcripts,

in this case, of, like, eight ads. You can always experiment.

I always know when I do this, there's going to be people who go,

well, what if I put 20 in there? What if I put 15?

What if I put 30? What if I, it's like, yeah, like,

I think I've said this a bunch of times at this point in RBC2.

Feel free to experiment. You're an experimenter and a scientist,

and you should have that mentality. Uh,

also, though, most of the experiments you want to do are probably going to

give you incremental gains.

There probably aren't going to be really big gains, if any,

or it's going to just be different, but not better.

So, that doesn't mean you can't find one that is,

like, totally better than what I'm sharing. Uh,

but, keep that in mind. There's some,

there's certain people who, I know you're going to try to get,

like, hyper-focused and fixated

on, know, tweaking these processes,

as a distraction from actually doing the work that's going to actually move the

needle for you. So, I'm not calling out everybody,

I'm sure plenty of you aren't that way, but there are people that way,

I mean, just know from experience, and what I would say is,

I would urge you to, you know,

if there's not a really good reason to do it, use the processes,

rather than try to, like, tweak them, you know,

because,

you know, just to tweak them. Uh, you know, unless you're just bored and

have time and then go nuts. So,

the same thing I just put here, it's literally,

like, what the project's about when you create a project,

and then it's again here, in the,

like, description, and then it's again here.

And I've shown it a bunch of times, but one more time in case

somebody skips this module, you would just go create new project.

You'd name it, right, so,

name it, like, Quad 3, the 7-minute VSL generator,

boop. What are you trying to achieve? Copy this,

paste it in, boop. Now you have this.

Here's the knowledge base. You would,

you could hit plus to add content, or you can just drag and drop

PDFs into here. And that's it,

right? And what I have in here is,

Like I said, quad projects for different lengths.

So, long form,

got an Agora financial one, if you watched that brief,

uh, example for the financial one,

like, you saw how crazy that got. It was pretty,

pretty amazing. Um,

a Beverly Hills MD pinch test, one that I taught during the VSL training

that you should've, should've, should've, already watched, like, the VSL trainings on,

sort of, theory, structure, going through them.

Uh, Backyard Liberty, this is,

I was like, yeah, what the hell, you know, this is, like, a classic,

uh, survival letter from way back in the day,

I thought, yeah, it'd be fun to put that one in. Uh,

this one from Emma Relief is really good and, and pretty,

like, white hat. Uh, Genius Wave is,

like, you know, a manifestation offer that was really successful on QuickBank,

I figured, hey, it'd be cool to put a manifestation offer in the mix.

Mydalene's a really aggressive weight loss offer on

QuickBank, I thought that'd be cool. So,

I honestly didn't know a ton about these guys, but their copy's pretty good,

and it was a swipe builder, and I said, hey, what the hell, let's

put this one in. It's pretty, it seemed pretty white hat when I read

through it, to be honest with you. Um, and then, like,

a BizOp one, right? And,

what's cool with the way this process goes,

a couple things. I mean first of all Oh my gosh, like,

you know, back in the day I would, I would teach a lot about

stuff on ClickBank, and I wrote stuff for ClickBank a lot,

and then I sort of got called out for that, like,

kind of rightfully, there's, I'm not, I still don't pass judgment,

um, it's not my place, but,

you know, there's really aggressive stuff on ClickBank,

and people make claims, and, you know, you can get a lot of ethical

quandaries there, and I totally get it, but that doesn't mean the copy is

not good. of it. Right? It might just mean that some of it's inaccurate,

or whatever it is, or, or, you know, there's some questionable things with ClickBank

copy, um, but,

copy can still be good, and what you'll find is, like,

you already saw this, I shared sort of examples with the,

you know, the iSerum, and the financial other, I mean, the financial model off

this, but the point is, even if you had this as really aggressive,

if you had something, you could give it to an LLM, and it would

just make less aggressive claims, um,

especially if you told it to, and then,

you know, the structure might still be really good. But also,

what's really important is, if you look at these prompts,

like, one of

the really key phrases, you know, analyze the various structures, synthesize that knowledge,

and use that same knowledge along with your judgment to produce a new long-form

VSLs. This is what's cool.

So, my original CLAWD, or, yeah,

CLAWD and just LLM, like, copywriting process,

was much more so swipe-specific

sales letters. And there's still value to doing that.

Like, again, kind of like what you saw financial,

it's like, hey, here's, like, a winning sales letter,

here's all the inputs, right, aka the brief,

right? That you need to write a new one. So, basically,

just rewrite this winning sales letter with these briefs,

but basically model and swipe the structure really closely.

And then in editing, I would go through and change it enough to make

it different. That still works.

I'll still show, I'll do a module, kind of showing some examples of that.

But it also becomes problematic. I mean, your swipes are really close to other

people's. There's times where you might want that,

right? Like, I really want to, you know, it's my VSL,

and I want to swipe my VSL for another category,

and I want it to be exactly the same. But if you're like a

copywriter, and you're sort of told to swipe a winning thing,

like, it becomes, you know, it can be maybe too close for comfort.

And whether that's how you feel about it, or a business owner feels that

way when they get the copy, or they don't feel that way,

but then they get sort of into a big dispute.

Somebody else, right, like, it's sort of, there's, there's,

there's landmines that you need to dodge, uhm,

but when we do it this way, and we're like, you know, basically synthesize

the information, and essentially create a composite,

we avoid a lot of those problems, because it's going to take the best,

well, or at least good elements from all of these sales letters,

whatever length they are, and then create new stuff.

So, that's the kind of simple way to set up,

and then you can go through and make a project for each one of

these in Claude, number five will not be, you probably won't see this,

this has got some old stuff that I originally put into this drive folder

while making, you know, organizing content, uhm,

but, ignore that one, because again,

most of that probably will not make it into the final RMBC2,

which is why I'm not going through it, but you can set up these

different projects, and then,

we can use them to generate different things to copy,

now you already saw that, with, like, the Unity Iceram,

for example, uhm, you saw it with Financial,

uh, the Blood Sugar example I did,

too, uhm, lots of examples, so,

that's it, short-ish section here,

uh, but then the next section, we'll start actually writing

copy using those Claude projects,

right, or, or producing, creating, whatever you want to call it,

copy using Claude projects, so that'll be the next section.

Next step. Alright, thank you.
