hey what's up everybody it is Stephan

georgei here and I'm going to be doing

this training on funnel economics and

really the levers that can be the

difference

between you know scaling or not scaling

an extremely profitable business or a

business that loses money a business

that gets off the ground or a business

that never gets off the ground um and

I'm going to show you the kind of dirty

math that you need to know and you

should note right out the gate I am not

good at math in fact I really struggled

with all types of math uh you know

besides a little bit of you know

business math I like because it's about

making money but I really hope this

should shift to off my headset I don't

need

it I'm pretty excited about this to be

honest with you I hope I hope you know

this ends up being as exciting to you as

it is to me

right I'm going give a second cuz my

camera froze but I'll be back on sure

okay I you know I really this should be

gamechanging um I don't see a lot of

people talk about this stuff publicly

maybe because it feels overwhelming or

complex or complicated but I really hope

it doesn't for you it's not that bad if

I can do it you can do it uh and again

it's like a superpower and you know I've

talked about it back in 201 18 19 in

copy St Pro so I'm tempted to be like

you know everyone's uh favorite Guru and

say like I invented this and nobody's

talking about this I am the function of

everything but let's not go down that

rabbit hole um it turns out you know

this is the kind of math that really the

the world's best direct response

marketers CMOS and business owners are

aware of uh it just doesn't get talked

about publicly very often and so I'm

excited to talk about it with you here

okay so first and foremost one of the

big questions you're going to ask or you

should ask and be able to answer is for

whatever the the offer the the funnel

the business that you're working on it's

kind of like what's the goal right

is it to maximize your net profit is

then both kind of like a percentage in

the volume so you know you want to just

make uh boatloads of cash and you buy

Lambos and houses and planes right

uh that's generally what it is for most

people of course some people might want

to maximize Revenue they might say top

line revenue is what matters I know that

if I can get a certain amount of Revenue

and I'm not completely hemorrhaging

money then I can get acquired um I can

sell my business business you know

revenue is my goal generally that should

be there should be that should be the

reason otherwise revenue is a vanity

metric so you I know people have done 50

million a year and taken home 500,000 in

profit which is like not bad but for 50

million that's it is bad right uh

maximizing new customers or you know

leads right so lead gen again maybe

acquisition wow we're we're you know a

machine we're acquiring all these

customers this is like a a Le genen or

customer generation machine

uh you know we're going to acquire those

customers are going to you back it out

by selling to them this is like Leen

right and there's lifestyle stuff like

hey high margin low headache like I

don't not trying to buy a Lambo that I

can make a couple $100,000 a year pretty

passively then you a couple million

whatever it is uh like I'm happy I don't

want a lot of headaches I don't want to

spend a lot of time in the business it's

all about that lifestyle okay uh and the

decisions you make as you go around

optimizing offers and funnels and and

the levers pulling the levers really

will depend on what your answer is and

what your goal is right I'm going to

assume for this training that generally

we're going to talk about maximizing net

profit but you know of

course I'm sure I can throw in tidbits

on other stuff too okay so here's some

really vital basic questions we're going

to go

through how much and I I could have done

a PowerPoint but I now even good at it

and I was like I just want to record

this cuz I'm pretty excited so I'm doing

it as a Google doc and you know you'll

bear with

me

uh all right how much does it cost me to

acquire a customer on average that' be

your CPA cost PR acquisition or your CAC

you know cost um to acquire customer or

cost per acquisition you know that type

of thing okay how much money do I gross

on day Zero when I acquire that customer

on average that be your aov right what's

your average order value when somebody

goes to funnel and buys you know maybe

have upsells uh maybe have different

package options what's the average

amount somebody spends that you're kind

of grossing is like your gross revenue

right what's my cost to fulfill a

customer's order on average so okay when

people come in and you know buy

something uh what you know what is the

cost for the cogs so for example

supplement funnel maybe you know we're

about to get to examples but say

$200 and it costs you you know $50

between uh you know the

supplements the uh fulfillment

processing fees some other stuff like

that right generally these are like the

the fixed kind of costs related to

selling the goods versus kind of other

variable costs like staff and payroll

and that's that's why all that leads to

your gross but not net margin right what

is the average gross profit when I

acquire that customer what's my gross

margin

and we're going to talk about the

lifetime value which is LTV a bit later

okay so let's look at some examples

let's say it's a supplement

offer and it costs you

$150 on average to acquire a customer

let's say that your aov is

$220 on average we'll say that your cogs

are about 22.7% and no I'm not a math

genius I just had looked that up earlier

um but that would make it that about $50

um

to uh you know fulfill so basically 150

+ 50

$200 that's costing you right it's

costing you

$150 for you know acquiring the customer

whether that was buying media right for

your ads cost $150 to get a customer

from an ad or say you were working with

Affiliates and you're paying Affiliates

$150 CPA so they're risking their money

but ATT to make a sale they get $150

okay and then you know your cogs will St

on average of $50 your grossing you know

through the aov

220 which means your gross profit is $20

now that's not bad of course if you know

we extrapolate out to like a th000 sales

a day type of thing you know I mean and

we're going to get to 1,000 sales a day

let's say it's 100 sales a day right so

100 sales a day * 20 equals right like

basically 2,000 dollar a

day equals uh like what about $60,000 a

month yeah you do that you've got

a you know probably seven figureure

business I mean 100

times 220 aov right so yeah you got you

have

a you know a healthy little business

you're

netting uh close to a million dollars a

year you know what's it 720,000 I think

right um so like you know this is is

probably a good like lifestyle business

if you could figure that out now there's

still a lot of things that you could do

there's a lot of levers you could pull

that I would want to pull if for me but

the point is it's actually right you

know it's kind of about volume typically

for especially for saying like a sell an

offer

okay okay but now let's say you got

something an offer where you know it's

costing you

$300 to acquire each customer whether

that's you know through Affiliates or

more realistically this what happen with

ads right um you know let's say you're

only your aov is only

150 your cogs are still $50 that

22.7% uh so now you're losing $200 of

every customer you require right and

that's

where I typically say you know when

people like I I've gotten in trouble for

being like not everyone should be an

offer owner it's like that's not out of

the question that this is what the

numbers are going to look like when you

first you know go out the gate

especially if like something like a

physical product like a supplement offer

and so and you need data to be able to

optimize right and

so if

[Music]

you you know are losing $200 per

customer how much money can you really

afford to spend right and if You' got

$55,000 saved up it's like okay so

basically you know what you can

run not that many sales before you're

out right um and it's hard to optimize

that period of time

so just keep that in mind but of course

you know if we're being a CMO or an ADV

an advisor and kind of growth engineer

whatever it is for uh you know another

company that has a testing budget that

understands the way things work all of

that uh then or you have the budget for

it right then this it's cool but that's

you know this is not out of the question

that you're going to have something like

this in fact I'll show you an example

momentarily okay just so you can see the

the metrics for a few other kind

of uh types of offers okay like let's

say it's a low ticket info product let's

say your CPA is $40 right you run ads on

average you spend $40 per customer or

Affiliates promote it whatever it

is on day Zero you know youire the

customer say $60 which is great there's

no costs really to fulfill

um you know because it's an info product

it's digital so your gross is $20 so

from that

context if you get $20 of this or

$20 uh running you know

physical you know there's an Allure to

doing info products right and I think

that's what certain gurus kind of talk a

bunch about like offer owners but then

they they go to like info and low ticket

info and it's people spending like a

couple Grand maybe they scale up to like

you know 30 40 Grand and add spend a

month or whatever it is which is again

nothing wrong with that um it really

depends on you and your goals and it's

typically hard to

scale it's harder to scale low ticket

info products and offers compared to

physical products right okay last

example High ticket funnel okay let's

say it cost $1,000 on average because

you know you're going to get a lot more

money

on you know

day uh when you do acquire a customer

right so say it's $1,000 you got acquire

a lot of customers it's like a phone

phone sales thing right you they apply

book a call you know you sell them a

high ticket package so say an average

cost you 1,000 bucks you bring in $3,000

let's say cost you $1,000 for

fulfillment let's say that's because of

um maybe you've got like a high ticket

closer you pay commission to maybe

there's like a coach or somebody who is

uh you know doing the coaching and you

kind of figure out the math on that

whatever it is but even here maybe your

gross profit is like $1,000 or gross

margin gross profit same thing right um

for my purposes it is uh th000 bucks

like all right

great okay so the reason this is so

important and the reason we looked at

these examples is because understanding

these basic numbers right really

determines what action we're going to

take next in our Focus as a CMO or a

marketer or as an offer owner or

whatever it may be so like let's go back

to this example uh of the supplement

offer a here right it's like we're in

pretty good shape we're propably

acquiring customers on Day Zero which is

fantastic right so cool but if you're in

the other example which I didn't put

back here example

two well [ __ ] right that's going to be a

very different direction that you

take

so basically your question is after you

know your numbers what do you do next

and it really depends on

your or the business's goals and

objectives going back to those four main

goals we can bullet

these right okay maximize profits

Revenue new customers lifestyle type of

stuff because if you frankly if it's

going well and you got a good lifestyle

then you're really in preservation mode

you're not you'll test stuff every now

and then you're like how can I increase

my lifetime value a little bit um you

know but you're really like the

lifestyle is typically

like this but instead of maximizing it's

sort of just like maintaining steady

profits growing steadily things of that

nature

right okay but we're going to assume you

want to go maximizing profits because

that's the world I live in and operate

in and love so what can we do okay well

you know and let's actually you know go

back to it doesn't really matter what's

funny right even if you've got your $150

CPA or $300 CPA right these are things

you would still do we could lower the

CPA well how can we do that okay you can

do it at the ad level right you can find

better ads what does that mean ads have

a higher click-through rate and a lower

CPM so you're spending less money uh per

visitor your

website and when you do that uh you know

I I'll show you this in fact Let me let

me go and show you this one real quick

before we go to the next one so let's

say your website converts

at

2% to be just or whatever right on cold

traffic from Facebook okay and let's say

you get 1,000 visitors a

day and if your current

ads it costs let's

say you know I don't know trying to

think I'm trying to think about

realistic math here what it would

cost I mean let's say you're

spending I I'll keep this simple 3,000

uh let's put this add spend

$3,000 with current ads okay all right

cool so th000 visitors a day 2%

conversion rate it means you know 20

customers per day say your aov is

$200

right that means you know you're kind of

grossing

$4,000 but with your cogs which are you

know let's

say you know I don't know like basically

20 20% for simplicity's

sake um you know 20% 4,000 is like 800

right

so 800 so maybe

making $2 a day okay does that all make

sense right th000 visitors A Day ad SP

$3,000 you're gain 20 customers per day

so your aov is $200 your average order

value or that sorry that's not so

basically

um

th000

uh's the sorry there's conversion rate

that's I'm sorry so like th000 a day a

day 2% conversion rate 20 customers per

day add spend

$33,000 um right so like that means

means yeah and then your

CPA is what $

3,000 divid by 20 just going to do easy

3,00

divided by 20 150 duh okay

um all

right so like Neato okay but when I talk

about better ads okay so now let's say

that you you have a really really fire

ad that you know is going to have a

higher more people are going to click on

this ad um

and you know because it's relevant owed

in your cost to run the ads the same so

that instead of you know

having and I'll do this in a new thing

here I make this clear landing page

Landing

okay

so all right let's say now if like

better

ad now for the same ad spend you get

let's just double it for Simplicity sake

again this is just these are just I just

want you understand these

Concepts right now you get 2,000

visitors a day your ad spense still is

$3,000 so now you're getting 40

customers per day and What's happen to

your CPA it's going to be cut in half

right $75 your aov stays the same but

now you're making more money per day

right because now your

gross is you know 200 * 40 is

$8,000 your cogs doubled to $1,600 right

just roughly

here um so if you subtract you know ad

spend of $3,000 cogs of

$1600 so 4600 minus 8,000 you're still

making

$3,400 a day right now that's a big

difference that you're going to go from

1,000 visitors to 2,000 visitors with

the same ad because of ads it's not

impossible but even if you got it you

know 1,200 visitors or500 visitors or

whatever it is uh you know that that's

what we're talking about with why on the

ad level and of course what does that

involve a lot of testing you know could

be targeting strategies Facebook's

algorithm is pretty good if we're doing

Facebook and most of these big platforms

um you know if you're doing email it

could be a new email creative that just

gets you know more clicks and you're

paying for drops right you're pay s

paying

$5,000 or $3,000 per email drop and um

I'm buying out list for $3,000 and now

with a really good creative instead of

getting 1,000 clicks I get 2,000 clicks

that's a very that's actually a very

realistic thing right I mean the $3,000

you might pay more but the idea being

that you could double the amount of uh

clicks you get realistic you have to be

a big email list to get that many clicks

but it's it's realistic enough okay all

right

cool okay so you can also increase

conversion so how do you do that well

you can have you know better landing

pages this is where copy rating comes in

really specifically right if I have a

new sales letter and it doubles

conversions okay great um um you're

running AB tests so things like the

button color or page elements things of

that nature better customer Journey

we're going to talk about that more in a

minute you know for example maybe you've

got a quiz funnel and the you ask people

questions they get to a landing page

they see the product they buy and you

realize that the quiz is screwing things

up and by changing the quiz you can get

way more people to the landing page way

more people buy um you know conversion

rate goes up right just general

conversion rate optimization stuff where

you're you're either through copy design

page

elements

testing you're increasing conversions a

lot of people live in this space as a

CMO or a cro expert and there's nothing

wrong with that it's a great space to be

in um you know one of many things you

could also find alternate traffic

sources remember what our goal here

we're talking about is lowering the CPA

right so what does that mean well maybe

you know your media buyers just kind of

suck and their creatives suck and yada

yada so still the cves but it's like

maybe you know the media buyers are

crappy and you're working with an agency

you should find a new agency maybe you

want to test other AD platforms and you

find that you can get you know better

conversions on YouTube than you did on

Facebook right um if you're working with

Affiliates maybe you're able to find a

way to bring on new Affiliates at a

lower CPA so you're paying Affiliates

150 but you can pay new Affiliates 120

uh and they're happy with it because

you're metrics are good enough well hey

look at that you've lowered your CPA and

there's also some fun stuff like

abandoned card and declines branded

keywords and organic and Amazon which

I'll talk about the abandons and

declines a lot branded keywords would be

for example you could run Google AdWords

so still kind of paid traffic but um say

you're selling

Miracle brush and it's like a hairbrush

right then you should you know run

Google AdWords so people search for

miracle brush um they you know you come

up first cuz there's a lot of buyer

intent there they try to see if you're

legit and you'll usually be able to get

sales for like $20

instead of $150 or $100 or $80 right

like or like the cost will go down a lot

on that so that's one really thing that

everyone should do and actually I need

to do it for my uh pepti company that

I'm CMO and Equity partner and that I'm

going to talk about in a minute and I em

somebody they get back to me I'm going

to Emil somebody else I'm just

remembering that right now um and then

you organic right SEO you're ranking for

SEO um you've got a good web presence so

I'm not just saying that because of SEO

like is then people find you organically

and buy that would lower your CPA

obviously um but also maybe like they go

to search for you and again they see a

good web presence and they buy or they

go to Amazon they see and they buy and

you know your kind of cost uh for those

customers is lower so the effectively

your cost per acquisition goes down okay

that's just lowering the CPA okay I know

this going to be a lot like I said so if

we take a pause we've looked at the

metrics and now we're looking at you

know what can we do to like maximize

profits we looked at the goals as well

and we decided for maximizing profits

what can we do do well we can lower CPA

that's one goal right okay so we can

also lower the

cogs wa so we can see it okay so um you

know if you're doing physical stuff

maybe it's a different fulfillment

partner manufacturer if you go from

paying $5 per bottle to $3 per bottle

for a supplement okay that's

$2 but if the average person's you know

buying five bottles that's $10 if you're

doing you know a th000 sales a day um

right now that's

$10,000 $300,000 a month um so that

would help you maximize profit right

that's $300,000 in found money same

thing fulfillment but you're paying for

shipping all that you know you can also

negotiate lower rates on shipping and

products with your existing provider you

could lower merchant processing fees um

most people don't ever think about that

but you know maybe you pay 5% for every

sale to the bank so for every $100 you

have to give the bank $5 and you can

lower that to 2.5 same thing adds up

right uh save $2.50 per transaction as

an example you're doing 1,000

transactions per day that's $2,500 a day

times 30 right you can kind of see

that's what 80 9,000

right yeah um I think don't again I'm

not Ming I think right right but oh well

yeah you save $90,000 a month you know

over a million dollars a year or even

$80,000 whatever but

um and then you know if you're doing

like info things like that maybe have

different people doing fulfillment if

you got coaches maybe you can find

another coach who's more cost effective

things that nature as well right so all

those things would would help to

maximize profitability also okay next up

is you can increase the aov okay so we

think about our metrics

again in fact let going go pull up my

little supplement offer

example example a was already pretty

good whatever that let just do

it okay so right now if the aov goes

from 220 it's like pretty high aov but

I'm just as an example anyway uh to like

250 okay so extra $30 say you're cost of

Phill goes up by like six bucks or

something like that okay fine but still

so now 150 plus 56 is 206 minus 250 is

now

$44 which is actually pretty significant

right so how do you increase aov well

you know it could be you know the aov

money close right and the copy thing

I've taught I'm sure you can find it

online or people talking about it

essentially you just tell the customers

repeatedly like to buy more oh you know

our biggest package is our

um you know most popular package and you

know that's why it makes so much sense

you'll save the most money when you buy

the big package you know buy that one

right um if you don't have other you

know you honestly I should put this on

here too you could you know

add more packages have to update the

rest of the document with this right

like um so that you can get a bigger so

say if you if you're only selling a one

or a three bottle option then adding a

six bottle option tell people to take

that will almost immediately increase

your average order value significantly

right um You can do an offer bump on the

checkout like hey before you check out

you know get this other supplement for

only $20 today and then someone cost you

$3 and $17 right similarly info like hey

you know $20 info product but hey before

you check out get like my you know a

th000 or I don't know my my 100 best you

know cheat codes for this thing for just

$27 more click that you basically just

made $27 additional net profit every

time somebody does it but you do test

those things because sometimes they can

then mess up your upsell so you really

want to test everything right AB testing

is is king um speaking of upsells right

you have better upsells if you're up

sell one you converts at like 20% and

you get that to 40% that's pretty

massive right so now instead of two of

every 10 people who see that upsell

taking it four of every 10 people take

it could add another $15 to $25 you know

maybe more to your um frankly much more

to your uh bottom line line um you know

and then pricing is another really big

one too right split test pricing and

people always want to go lower but you

also test charging more um I'll keep

using physical products like if you're

selling a bundle of products for n $19

for one product $29 per product for

three $39 per product for soor I'm kind

of doing reverse sorry 39 for one 29 for

per for three or 19 per for you know six

Maybe maybe you increase the one product

price to $49 or $59 maybe you increase

all the prices to make it 49 3929 or

5949 29 or 39 right testing price is a

really big needle mover um you know

something that a lot of people don't

spend enough time thinking about or

playing with and it can really move the

needle I can give you two examples uh

for skare offer I was involved with uh

that

did hundreds and hundreds of FR sales a

day

um you know we took the the single

bottle price from 59 to 79 and kept the

other prices the same and it increased

the aov and conversion to State exactly

the same um flip side of that we helped

a guy run a blood sugar supplement on

Facebook for several years he's still

running it doing you

know healthy I guess I don't know he's

doing think a million a month maybe

something like that um

and it was like we were doing I think

you know 69 59 49 69 for one bottle 59

per bottle for three $49 per bottle for

six and we lowered it significantly to

like I think

39 I want say 39 34

29 um and conversions like doubled or

tripled even and so even though the aov

was lower because we made s so much

higher conversions we were able to uh

you know that's what enabled us to scale

okay so that's where splitting you know

pricing split test is is really

valuable okay and then lastly we can

increase the lifetime value now I'll

talk more about this

um in a minute here actually Sor this a

few places but um you like subscription

right get them on continuity where they

get rebuilt every month make if you have

them uh on subscription you know help

them to stay on it for longer monetizing

your email list uh you know you could

you could rent your email list out to

Affiliates or promote other people's

funnels for a CPA every time you make a

sale you get money uh you can do warm

promotions to your list right we do that

with AI marketers and free copy and my

own list where we'll develop bundles

like the one that you probably found

this through and

um you know that enables us to bring in

really high margin Revenue that funds a

lot of stuff we do right um also phone

sales tax you could have a call center

calling people and selling them other

packages bundles offers

promos things like that

okay now I know that's a lot of options

again we talked

about

increasing

conversions lowering cogs increasing the

aov and increasing the

LTV like I said it's a lot of options so

let's go for a real real example this is

a um for peptide company which is

basically OIC some glutide things like

that that I'm CMO and Equity partner of

um these number I mean basically the

real the real Road on this is the cogs

and also it be gross for you know Day

Zero for customers

right and we've been working to dial in

the CPA and it's still all over the

place we have days where as of the time

I'm recording this uh the CPA is over

300 we have days where the CPA is like

$113 average is probably realistically

closer to 200 but you know let's say

it's

$300 okay so and there higher cogs

because it's like a medication soir

customer is 300

bucks $ 299 is what people get the

medication for in the first month then

it goes up to 399 after but we'll talk

about continuity after the fact

um okay it's expensive to fulfill

$145 so what is my gross

profit when I acire that customer $146

right minus

$146 and we got that gross profit

because again we basically just

took uh the CPA plus cogs 445 -

299

equals or sorry

um yeah like we get this back and so

basically there's a negative difference

of of 146 RS okay and let's get some

more data going back to those things

about conversions things like that right

so on a given

day uh prior to some of the

optimizations that I've been

doing uh you'll see 964 people hit the

any page from Facebook ads we have 10

conversions that's a 1.04% conversion

rate ad spend 3,000 CPA 300 this is sort

of a little bit hypothetical but to make

the math easy but not enough we've had

days like that uh give me one sec okay

so what questions would I ask right away

and in fact did I ask right I want to

know benchmarks so is that conversion

rate good is a CPA high low average

what's the Benchmark and how would I

find that out well I would ask people

who are running traffic to this kind of

offer right to friends who own this kind

of offer or who are media buyers or in a

mastermind one of the big values of

being a mastermind is you can go hey yo

guys I'm running this this is the aov

this is CPA um anyone else running this

type of thing what are you seeing right

if you're in a group a Discord whatever

fine but like that's one of the biggest

values is just having people who are

legit who can answer that right not like

oh my friend's friend but people you

know right so in my case I went to like

some of the best media buyers in the

world who I know and I'm like hey you

know they're running this stuff too like

what metrics are you seeing Oh okay

figuring out benchmarks right so like

you know in this case I kind know the

conversion rate should be higher and

more importantly I mean I know the CPA

should be lower it should be around $100

on average okay now I have a rough

Benchmark of what to optimize for so how

do we go about optimizing like what are

we going to do we want to optimize I

want to get the CPA down and I want to

get the conversion rate

up you how do I do that well if you have

Google analytics which is another one of

those things that people lot you

probably don't look at um but it's

actually very helpful you you can see

maybe where people are dropping off

there's also things like visual uh you

web Optimizer vwo or hot jar and heat

Maps things that can show you where in a

funnel uh somebody is dropping off and

giving you data that way you can

optimize their wow everyone's dropping

off on this page right especially in a

multi-step funnel in our case they click

a page on click a link on the landing

page go into questionnaire they have to

answer bunch of medical intake questions

because it's like a medication hip a

compliant yada yada drop off so right

and that's you know spoiler what I

decided to focus on First and we have

that going live tomorrow and we'll see

I'm optimistic but you never know um

because it's like well you could you

could also just Test new front end copy

lot people do that they sort of throw a

new copy at it hope the conversion rate

goes up and then they go wow it went up

and that's like the extent of their

split testing uh you could do cro stuff

right buttons page elements messaging

move around testimonials page design

you know people do all that stuff too um

you know there's no wrong answer what

you should just remember right what do

we what are we really trying to do like

why they help to increase conversions

but really at a higher conversion rate

can mean a lower CPA which can mean more

scale more profit right keep in mind why

we're doing this so it's not it's like

yes increasing conversions but really

conversion is going up so that CPA goes

down right there's a relationship

there okay so in the peptide funnel look

at my compartive pages is I'm like oh

their their Journey the flow has a lot

less friction than ours friction is a

huge thing for me um so friction is like

points of confusion things that are

difficult roadblocks that will stop our

customer from going you know into our

funnel and out the other side of

customer or say our Prospect from going

in and coming out a customer so right my

thesis has been simply like all right

let me simplify our flow which you can

call like a quiz I can probably double

conversion rates that's a big you know

big thing doubling conversion rates but

especially when a funnel is not very

optimized you know it's doable that's

the good news if you're are actually

decent and the funnel is optimized

you've got a lot of opportunity there

okay so like well if I'm right my new

metrics would look like this instead

right new still the same amount of

visitors to the landing page but instead

of 10 conversions you have 20

conversions the conversion rate would

double the asone would stay the same but

the CPA would be cut in half from $300

to $150 that's a massive difference okay

does that make sense because again now

for 3,000 ad spend you got 20

conversions that's what figures out the

CPA right conversion rate is sort of

just a metric to mark that that has

happened but really what you're I'm

really mostly interested in is the CPA

going down cuz when the CPA is down if

I'm making money I can keep scaling

right or if I'm intentionally okay with

losing money I can also keep scaling but

that's like that's like the goal like I

want to be if I'm profitable right and

it's consistent also by the way right

then for me for this funnel like if it's

consistently at 150 as an example like

all right then I know I can go to

Affiliates and give them $150 CPA and

reasonable chance that it will convert

you know well enough for them that they

are going to be uh happy and keep

sending traffic to it especially if they

have a high volume of traffic right if

we go back to our initial numbers here

um so right now instead of costing me

$300 to acquire a customer cost me 150

the aov doesn't change the cost of

fulfill doesn't change but instead of

losing $146 and making $5 that might not

seem like life changing money but

actually with all the rebuilds and stuff

which I'll talk about in a little bit it

it would still be great um but

regardless it's a huge win uh and you

can you know you can like I mentioned

find Opportunities to double your

conversions through testing although

also if you can't do that then a bunch

of little incremental tests and wins uh

can also add up to a doubling of

conversions too so you know both

strategies Mak sense if there's an

fairly unoptimized funnel and you can

find home runs it's worth doing that

right okay so let's assume this this

test works I actually really do think

it's going to work I'll update in a few

days probably before you ever see this

video I'll know if it worked or not not

and you can ask me and I can be like yay

or nay try to ask me public I really

want to talk about this funnel publicly

I'm talking about in this recording but

I don't want to go too you know so I can

stop there and I could scale because of

the rebuilds which we'll talk about in a

minute but you know there's just so much

more low hanging fruit so let's say that

by testing some different variants of

the landing page but that mean the copy

the design format elements I can

increase the conversion rate up to 2.5%

okay um and that's really not at all

unrealistic it's pretty doable to get

that kind of win all right well now my

numbers basically go from 20 to 24

conversions I go from

a or uh you know my conversion rate is

up to two or sorry yeah conversion rate

is not 2.50% so we had there same ad

spend but the CPA you just another four

sales there goes down to1 125 we knocked

another $25 off right so now my

numbers are CPA here these two didn't

change making now making $20 per profit

now if you say you're doing 1,000 fronts

a day right back to that we kind did the

math earlier on 100 20K gross Prof

profit per day 600k a month gross profit

right and even if you're just doing 100

sales a day 2K per day 60k a month like

for me that wouldn't be exciting um you

know but for lots of people I understand

that

would Okay cool so I think realistically

if other you know optimizations um split

tests of landing pages formats we are

testing some really cool variants you

know we can get to like a 3% conversion

rate but let's let's just keep it at

2.5% also I want percent I want to show

you what else I could be doing one of

the biggest low hanging fruits is going

to be like abandon carts and declines

right um you know in the case of the pep

company like we're getting around 300

abandoned carts daily and it's pretty

standard for a call center if they call

those abandoned cards to convert like

20% of them into call uh customers but

let's just say it's 10% to keep the math

simple and let's say we're paying our

cost that are $125 per conversion on an

abandoned cart which is accurate what

we're paying them right now okay um and

let's say that we also text an email out

like here's a sequence of like you know

they they abandon C right they're

they're in the process they don't check

out we email them hey you didn't check

out come back complete your purchase

text hey you didn't you know complete

your purchase come back check out um so

say we can get you know 5% of those

abandons to complete their purchase so

total 15% of of the people which is I

think realistic and frankly a little

below what the benchmarks would even be

well cool so now on the call center side

30 more sales per day right 300

abandoned

and our CPA is $125 per sale so you know

3,750 and kind of AD spend in this case

it's not ads but it's like spend to the

cost center and we're getting 15 sales

from our abandoned cart texting emails

with no CPA so now what the numbers look

like okay well that's pretty massive we

go from 24 to 69 conversions our

conversion rate kind of our effective

this is all effective because you're

working in the cost where costs are so

valuable right I just sold my call

center but we're now we're using them

and I'm kind of like crap I'm make them

a ton of money after I s them but that's

okay I I'll make a lot too um but your

kind of cost now is like add spend Plus

cost andent commissions but even with

that the CPA is now down to

$978 it started at

$300 as you'll probably recall and this

is really only three things that we've

changed right we look at the real world

real world examples we went from

$146 per customer to positive

$568 that's a lot better if we go back

to the whole sales the day thing now

we're looking at gross profit per day of

56180 and gross profit per month of

1,685 400 or if you want to say 100

sales per day then uh you know

$561 per day and you know

168,00 uh

$540 per month which is still pretty

good especially you know depending on

where you're at in your journey and what

you're looking for or the company is

whatever right

and remember all we really did was like

three things we just improved the

customer Journey which is kind of a cro

type of thing we found about landing

page and we started marketing you know

or remarketing to our abandoned cards

through a call center text right so this

is where there's so much leverage and

Power in these things and um people

should talk about them

more yeah okay and again think about all

the other stuff we could do what we

didn't do we didn't go find better ads

yet so for our pepti thing we I messed

me uh the person running Facebook

traffic for us and was like hey yo like

here's some ideas for ads let's like

test some these new ads out I think we

can lower CPM so we are doing that right

um we're testing a bunch of different

landing pages in the near future really

excited for that um we will expand onto

other AD

platforms uh we will probably you know

we'll work with Affiliates I want the

metrics really good before I go to

Affiliates um you know we like I said we

got to get adwards going and I actually

want do more kind of organic SEO stuff

cogs shortterm can't really lower them

but longer term we could and that could

increase our profit margin as well aov

yeah we could do that we could offer

people who have bought you know an

upsell right away or something or with

through the call center supplements uh

an anti nausea thing that's a side

effect of zic and some glutide things of

that nature we could even split tests we

can we we have price elasticity we could

test going lower or higher um with this

as well and of course there's increasing

the lifetime value so let's talk about

lifetime value right what is lifetime

value of your customer what's the

average uh additional expected lifetime

gross profit of the customer so let's go

back to that peptide company right these

are the metrics you just saw but what I

know is from competitors you know their

LTV is around

$2,000 and I know that the um you know

the margin on that for us it's about 50%

uh you know it's like a little bit back

of napkin for this but it's pretty damn

good so you know basically we can make

extra ,000 every time we acquire a

customer which is pretty wild

right um and you it's good to know so

this was like that LTV was over 6 months

that's how long we have the data so it's

not true LTV but at least I know you

know maybe it's longer right but for 6

months that's kind of what I'm looking

at so what does that mean well th000

divided by 6 means I'm getting an extra

$166 per month for each of those

customers for the next six months so

this is where the math gets wild and

this is where people love rebuilds and

continuing subscriptions right let's say

we're doing a th000 sales a day because

that's my goal my short-term goal

uh 30,000 customers a month you gross

profit gross profit margin right cool

now you get to month two same thing

right hey look at that it's good profit

but it's better than that because of

those rebuilds we do okay 30,000 people

from the first month $166 per month

that's $4,980 th000 in additional gross

profit in month two switch out to 100

sales a day okay

$498,000 additional profit in month two

right switch it to 10 sales a day oh

okay $49,800 additional now again this

has to be something that has a high Rebo

take rate and it's a high average order

value things like that right this is why

sasses are so valuable because you get

people on subscription the margins are

extremely high all that that's why

sasses will pay a lot of money to

acquire a customer um but and we'll talk

about that below as well that's why

Agora would and maybe still does acquire

customers and go negative for like

months at a time right if you're

wondering why is a gross profit so much

higher with rebild is cuz there's no ad

costs in the the additional months and I

can play that out over one more month

right now you've got 60,000 people you

got people uh you know in month three

and in month two uh you know so now your

net profit after 3 months is that which

is pretty insane that's how you know one

way to quickly get to being a nine

figure business that's what I'm trying

to do and I hope I do it frankly you

know I'm you never know I could record

this and things go to [ __ ] doesn't work

out um but I feel pretty optimistic I'm

really working hard on this thing right

now because of the upside and being you

know a significant Equity partner in it

okay and yeah like I said those numbers

are insane but they're not out of the

question and it's like I said if you're

doing 100 sales a day then in you know

month three you're only netting you 1,1

164,000 like oh no right and like I said

this is why people love subscription

business and of course there's other

things we can be doing as well you could

increase the stick rate how many people

uh you know

do uh renew for another month or youand

their medication or you know if you're

doing a newsletter how many people stay

on your newsletter uh the email list of

monetization right we can take all our

buyers and we can sell them supplements

by creating warm traffic offers we could

sell them affiliate stuff right um we

could say you know hey customers go

check out vred and sell them vshreds

programs like you know want to lose

weight and get off of zic you know do

that right um you know we could call

them sell them packages of Fitness

coaching Health coaching all these

things we can do right um and so it's

kind of endless and it's all really fun

so I guess yeah I'll get to final notes

in a second but you know I hope this is

starting to change the way you look at

funnel economics and really running a

business in general and you understand

this sort of dirty but important funnel

math cuz it really is to me it's so

important to know these numbers and

understand how this works I think I

didn't know it until I was running my

own offer or offers and then really even

then it was sort of like money in the

bank more money in the bank at the end

of the month than at the start of the

month like great and I realized like

this is not the way to do it right

there's there's so much there's levers

and there's specific metrics and you

optimize to these metrics and these

numbers and you know it can make you

rich or it can make the business rich

and you promote it and then you go start

your own offer and Company or you become

a partner because you're doing such a

good job in that business or whatever it

is right um or you're just as a

freelancer just be like a consultant who

can come in and know this [ __ ] and like

work with companies and charge them a

lot of money to to to find the levers

and pull them and tweak them it's

extremely valuable right so here's like

just a quick example from like a while

back was like a bad day for the peptide

company right we had six sales um should

said from not form from Facebook for uh

you know $1,970 ad spent so $328 CPA but

the call center started up that day

right and we're paying $125 commission

right so if you add the math up on that

basically between $1,000 to the call

center put that in PR so it's

easier um and the ad spend 29793

but now we have 14 sales that takes the

CPA from 328 down to 212 right we had a

couple sales come in for the abandon and

stuff that we're setting up um yeah we

offer a coupon code but one person came

in that didn't use the coupon code so

okay same ad spend here as here but now

17 sales now our CPA was

17476 we also had five rebuilds come in

again this is like the first month of

doing that or I guess the second month

but you know second rebs come in so we

got about $20 net profit on those

rebuilds on average um the reason I said

166 before is because not everybody's

going to rebuild so I'm averaging that

out it's a high stick rate but not a

100% stick rate so $1,100 net profit on

the rebuilds and so when you look at it

that way right okay

174 our um you know Break Even is

essentially 154 so say we lost $20 per

on 17 sales right so again just lazy CU

my brain's pred so we basically lost 3

$40 acquiring customers but we actually

for the day netted 1100 minus you 340

which again I'm too tired to do

mad $760 we made profit right and now

when those 17 new people rebu next month

right and then 100 people rebu per day

next month this is where that math gets

really exciting and fun and why I'm I'm

really pumped about doing this stuff um

and so it also comes back to that

question right how much are you willing

to spend to acquire a customer um and

it's not can you spend but willing to

spend and they're kind of both but

sometimes you can spend more than you

want to because you are you know

optimizing for profit but you might be

willing to spend more than other people

because you don't care about going

negative right in theory I think I have

it down here

um yeah like it's like in theory knowing

what I know about the rebuilds and LTV

and stuff like that it's like I couldn't

Theory be like I don't give a damn that

my CPA is $300 or $500 let's just go but

you really would want a foundation of

rebuilds coming in first uh to have the

money and then you really have your

numbers out you get CPA or somebody like

CFO type level you can hire a fractional

one you have to go hire a CFO for a

bunch of money to help you understand

what the modeling looks like on that but

if you do that you know then you might

be like damn I don't care I can acquire

I want to actually spend more right and

I put that in here um yeah I mentioned

it here right like in theory we should

be willing to go negative a lot of money

to acquire customers right and I

mentioned AG gor does this famously you

you just need upfront money to play that

game though or enough rebs coming in to

do it but the pro of going negative is

that you know you can acquire more

customers you can dominate your market

so in this case you know you're going to

end up paying a higher CPA instead of

trying to lower your CPA but you're

going to be happy about it but the

difference there is I would still be

trying to optimize for CPA I would still

try to lower it but I would accept you

know especially as I go broader my CPA

is going to go up or if I go from

especially a lot of niches and if it's

it's not a really like you know if it's

not a niche where everybody it's not a

massive Market or Tam right total

dressable Market which we all know now

because of heroi um sorry my family is

about to be is perfect right then just

CPA is going to go up in general I'm

still trying to keep that CPA down I'm

fighting it because I'm trying to manage

for profitability but also LTV um and

this also happens when you go broader

right you go from you know a Facebook ad

to a billboard then you're going to

spend more money acquiring customers but

if you've got enough money coming in

lifetime value all that you can do it so

that's actually it it's perfect cuz uh

Laura and my daughter just got home

perfect timing I hope this was really

valuable and really made a lot of sense

to you I hope it gives you a really good

new way of thinking about funnel

economics obviously you'll have access

to this document as well my dog's

freaking out so I'm going thank you all

and bye
