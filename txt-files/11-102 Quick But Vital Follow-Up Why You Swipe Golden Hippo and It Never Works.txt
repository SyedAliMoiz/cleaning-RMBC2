I actually want to make one more point in this module,

um, it'll be fast,

but this is the same reason why so many people,

and it's super annoying, I don't know if it's annoying, I'm not trying to

be like a d***, sorry, but it does get me frustrated.

They see what Golden Hippo,

or, you know, does, like Dr. Gundry, and infeed VSLs,

and and then they want to do a VSL, is on page,

like, you know, in their funnel, and they go,

well, Dr. Gundry's crushing it,

so I want to do a VSL like that, and I've had

this happen when I've, like, been a freelance copywriter,

I see other brands and people try and do it, and then they go

to do it, and it, like, never works for them,

right, and I brought this up in the past in emails and things where

I've ranted about it a little bit, part of the reason why is because

of the economics for Gundry and,

like, their whole call center, they're a huge company,

they're really dialed in, you're probably not as dialed in as they are,

but another huge part of it is that educational component,

so someone takes that educational component from their in-feed stuff and goes,

wow, I'm going to run that on my on-page, but they don't realize that

where the psychologically prospect is at is a different,

it's a different journey, and they're not going taking this journey into account, and

it's one of the reasons why so many people go to swipe GundryMD or

other brands that they see running in-feed VSLs that are especially long,

and they go, like, you know, oh, wow, I'm going to do that same

thing, and it never works for them, but, like, it's like,

I can't tell you how many times I've seen big people waste, big brands,

people who've lost money, waste $50,000,

$100,000, $150,000 for this exact reason.

And so, while this doesn't apply to everyone,

it should apply to you, and same thing for the copywriters who watch this,

who go, oh, my gosh, like, you know, I'll just swipe Dr.

Gundry for this client, they won't say, like, Gundry,

it's on feed, like, hey, you know, avocados for health,

no, like, wrong, it's like, that's why it doesn't work when you go to

do it, and then you bomb for your client,

and don't get hired again, so, I just wanted to add that point,

because it's actually know, quite important,

uhm, like, so important. Okay, thanks.
