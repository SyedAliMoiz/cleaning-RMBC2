# Product Pages: Overview and Claude Processes for Writing New Ones

Product pages (PDPs) are essentially the modern evolution of what we used to call e-com landing pages or text sales letters. The terms are largely interchangeable.

## The Primary Rule: You Must Do the Selling Somewhere

With very few exceptions, you must educate and sell somewhere in your funnel. The question isn't whether you need to sell, but where the selling happens.

### Rare Exceptions: Trend Hijacking

The only products that can avoid extensive selling are historically in-demand products that everyone knows work and wants—GLP-1 medications being the prime example. When you successfully hijack a trend, the zeitgeist already creates demand, and you only need to establish:
- Trustworthiness
- Fast delivery
- Strong reviews
- Competitive offer

These circumstances are extremely rare. For virtually everything else, education and selling are essential.

## Purpose of Product Pages

Product pages serve multiple (sometimes overlapping) purposes:

### 1. Heavy Selling
Doing the primary sales work through extensive copy and persuasion

### 2. Branded Experience While Pushing Prospects Over the Hump
Creating a professional, trustworthy brand presentation while addressing final objections

### 3. Both Simultaneously
Many successful PDPs combine extensive selling with strong branding (Happy Mammoth, Emma Relief)

## The Length Formula: Inverse Relationship

**Simple principle**: The amount of selling needed is constant—you must distribute it across your funnel assets.

### Long PDP Scenarios
**When to use**:
- Short static ads
- Short video ads (1-2 minutes)
- Short or no advertorial

**Why**: Prospects arrive with minimal pre-selling, so the PDP must do the heavy lifting

**Example**: Clarifion Odorex
- Long advertorial (Carol F. story) does extensive selling
- PDP is super basic and simple (essentially checkout + minimal copy)

### Short PDP Scenarios
**When to use**:
- Medium or long video ads (6-18 minutes)
- Long advertorials
- VSL in the funnel before PDP

**Why**: Prospects arrive already educated and sold, so PDP primarily facilitates purchase

**Example**: MiamiMD
- 12-16 minute VSLs do extensive pre-selling
- PDP is relatively short with good design but less copy than competitors

### The Notable Exception: Neuro

Neuro runs an unusual funnel structure:
- 15-minute video ad
- Long educational advertorial about the product
- Long product page

This format works well for them and a few others, but remains pretty rare as of mid-2025. Worth testing, but not the standard approach.

## Strategic Context: Where PDPs Fit

Product page strategy depends entirely on the customer journey before arrival.

### Journey Considerations
- What assets came before the PDP?
- How much selling already happened?
- What awareness level is the prospect at?
- What final objections need addressing?

Understanding this context determines whether you need a heavy-selling long-form PDP or a shorter branded experience.

## Case Study: Happy Mammoth

Happy Mammoth demonstrates both long and short PDP strategies depending on traffic source and customer journey.

### Short Homepage/Store Page
**Use case**: Likely retargeting or brand awareness campaigns

**Structure**:
- "Get your old self back naturally"
- Premium, evidence-based formulas
- 2.4 million women transformed
- Shop products section
- Best sellers showcase
- Social proof

**Strategic assessment**: Probably not profitable for cold traffic. Likely serves brand-building purposes or targets warm audiences already familiar with Happy Mammoth.

### Long-Form Product Page: Hormone Harmony

**Ad that drives to this page**:
"At 52, I got my figure back. It's been 12 years since I felt this good in my body. Since menopause, my body felt different in ways I didn't expect, and nothing seemed to help.

## Extracting PDP Structure with Claude

### The Process

Instead of creating elaborate Claude projects for PDPs, use this streamlined approach:

**Step 1: Find winning PDPs you want to model**

**Step 2: Extract structure with this prompt**:

```
I'm going to share [one or two] product page link(s) from a brand with you [for similar products]. Please review [it/them] and then I would like for you to create a templatized outline that captures both the structure and all of the common elements. This should be something someone could use for other products and brands to produce similar product pages.
```

**Step 3: Save the outline template**

**Step 4: Generate new PDP with this prompt**:

```
If we were going to create a new PDP for [product name] following this structure, what would it look like? Can you go ahead and create and write the copy for it and indicate other design and structural elements? [Either provide current PDP link OR attach brief with all necessary information]
```

### Example: Happy Mammoth Template Extraction

### Applying Template to New Product: Eye Serum Example

Using Happy Mammoth structure for eye serum product generates copy like:

**Headline**: "Why I threw away $2,000 worth of eye creams and finally got my 25-year-old eyes back at 52"

**Sub-headline**: "The world's first and only eye serum that targets the hidden skin cell separation causing 87% of eye aging. Prevent and reverse wrinkles, dark circles, and eye bags in as low as 14 days"

**Problem Agitation**: "As women hit their 30s, their eyes age 3x faster than the rest of their face. Groundbreaking study by dermatological researchers found that the delicate eye area loses collagen and elasticity at triple the rate of other facial skin"

**Real Problem Reveal**: "You need to stop wasting money on surface-level eye creams right now. Because you don't need more moisture, you need to stop your skin layers from separating. Every anti-aging cream on the market makes the same fatal mistake. They only work on the surface of your skin. The real damage is happening much deeper in the dermal-epidermal junction"

**Unique Mechanism of Problem**: "When you're young, these layers are tightly bonded together by tiny hooks, but here's the devastating truth. Starting at 30, these vital connections begin breaking down. The result: your skin layers literally start separating from each other. This is why no amount of expensive eye creams work, because you're treating the symptoms, not the cause"

**Solution**: "It's now possible to re-bond separated skin layers and reverse years of eye aging with UDI serum. For 8 years of research, we finally cracked the code. We created the world's first eye serum that penetrates deep into the dermal-epidermal junction to rebuild those crucial connections between your skin layers. The results: visible age reversal starts working in just 14 days"

**Scientific Breakthroughs**: "The 6 biggest anti-aging breakthroughs in the past decade locked in a single serum"
1. Harvard researcher's discovery of youth peptide
2. Swiss scientists reveal moisture agent that holds 100x its weight
3. German botanists uncover skin-lifting leaf that tightens loose eye skin
4. Japanese study exposes dark circle disorder that brightens under-eyes
5. French scientists create instant tightening compound from natural sources
6. American dermatologists identify collagen building blocks that rebuild aging skin

## Working with Different PDP Styles

### Emma Relief Template

Emma Relief follows somewhat similar structure to Happy Mammoth with key variations:
- Video component (5-minute explainer)
- "Surprising root cause" positioning
- Different visual presentation style
- Powerhouse ingredients section
- "How it works" section placement

By extracting this template separately, you can generate PDPs with Emma's style for different products.

### Portable Infrared Sauna Example

For completely different product categories (high-ticket devices vs supplements), the same extraction process works:

1. Find winning PDP in the category (or adjacent category)
2. Extract structure template
3. Apply to new product with brief or existing page info
4. Receive adapted copy maintaining structural logic

**Important context consideration**: $2,000 portable sauna would likely need:
- Decent video ads in front of PDP
- Potentially advertorial as well
- Not just static ad → PDP

The selling must happen somewhere, and high ticket items need more extensive pre-selling.

## Example PDPs to Study and Model

**Primal Queen**:
- Reportedly $10M+ per month
- Great design similar to Emma
- Excellent Yukon-ish brand style
- Strong model for premium supplement brands

**Clarifion Odorex**:
- Minimal PDP (checkout hybrid)
- Works because of long advertorial before
- Demonstrates inverse relationship principle

**MiamiMD**:
- Medium-length PDP
- Professional design
- Works with long-form video ads

**Happy Mammoth**:
- Multiple PDP styles for different traffic sources
- Long-form direct response + branding hybrid
- Template-based approach across products

## Critical Strategic Mindset: Aim for Doubles, Not Home Runs

### The Confidence Paradox

The better you get at marketing, the lower your confidence in any single approach working. This seems contradictory, but it's actually a sign of mastery. Here's why:

**What creates this paradox**:
- Greater understanding of nuance and context
- Recognition that many approaches can work
- Awareness that "perfect" is impossible to predict
- Testing reveals constant surprises

**What this means practically**:
- Don't try to pick the "perfect" funnel structure or copy
- Accept that something better always exists potentially
- Focus on creating solid, good work (doubles)
- Occasionally you'll accidentally hit home runs

**The baseball analogy**:
- **Aiming for home runs**: Striking out frequently
- **Aiming for doubles**: Consistently getting on base, occasional home runs happen naturally

### Multiple Approaches Will Work

The Happy Mammoth template would probably work for the eye serum. The Emma Relief template would probably work too. Even older templates, with updated design, could work (though perhaps not as well).

This isn't a bug—it's a feature. Multiple valid approaches exist. Your job is selecting solid ones and testing, not finding the mythical "perfect" approach.

### International Note

Sorry international readers, the baseball analogy stands. Watch a baseball game and figure it out.

## The 2025 PDP Creation Process

### What You Don't Need

You don't need elaborate Claude projects loaded with dozens of PDP examples. That was the original plan, but it's unnecessary.

### What You Actually Need

1. **Find PDPs you like** (ideally that you know work well)
2. **Extract the structure** using the simple prompt
3. **Apply to new product** using brief or existing page info
4. **Generate copy** that maintains structure but with new content

### Why This Works Better Than Traditional Swiping

**With VSLs**: Heavy swipe means very close copy, potential legal/ethical issues

**With PDPs**: You're extracting structure, but the brief creates different content
- Same outline and flow
- Different mechanism, claims, benefits, stories
- Not a problematic swipe, just structural modeling

**The Critical Part You're Extracting**: Structure and flow, not specific copy

### Ideal Selection Criteria

When choosing PDPs to model:
- **Ideally**: Know it's working (confirmed by data or reliable intel)
- **Second best**: Looks good structurally, similar vertical
- **Still valuable**: Good structure even if performance unknown

## Examples Included with Training

You'll receive links to multiple example PDPs across categories:
- Short PDPs
- Long PDPs
- Medium PDPs
- Different verticals (supplements, devices, info products)
- Different price points
- Different brands and styles

Study these to understand variation, then extract structures from your favorites.

## Course Update Policy

This represents the optimal PDP creation process for Summer 2025. If significant changes occur within the next year, RMBC2 will be updated accordingly.

## Summary: The Complete PDP Workflow

1. **Understand context**: Where in the funnel? What came before? How much pre-selling happened?
2. **Determine length need**: Short PDP (heavy pre-selling) or long PDP (minimal pre-selling)?
3. **Find structural model**: Locate working PDP with structure you like
4. **Extract template**: Use Claude to create reusable outline
5. **Apply to new product**: Provide brief or existing page info
6. **Generate initial copy**: Let Claude create first draft following structure
7. **Copy chief**: Edit, refine, improve like any other copy

That's the PDP process. Find what works, extract the structure, apply to new products, copy chief the results.
