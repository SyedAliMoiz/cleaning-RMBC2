# Abandoned Cart Overview: Economics and Consumer Psychology

Welcome to the email marketing module. This section covers multiple email sequence types:
- Abandoned cart sequences
- Welcome sequences
- Winback sequences
- Promotional sequences

This overview focuses on abandoned cart sequences—a relatively easy, quick implementation that business owners can use to make more money. Subsequent videos will cover the other sequence types, followed by a Claude project for generating all these email sequences.

## The Funnel Economics of Abandoned Cart Recovery

### Baseline Scenario: Without Cart Recovery

**Traffic spend**: $5,000

**Checkout visits**: 100 people

**Purchases**: 20 people buy

**CPA (Cost Per Acquisition)**: $5,000 ÷ 20 = $250

**AOV (Average Order Value)**: $150

**Day zero revenue per new customer**: $150

**Loss per customer**: $250 - $150 = **-$100**

**This is not sustainable.**

### Improved Scenario: With Cart Recovery

**Additional conversions**: 15 people who abandoned checkout buy through email, SMS, or call center (we'll focus on email)

This represents **15% of the 80 people** who abandoned (80 people visited checkout but didn't buy; 20 original buyers + 15 recovered = 35 total customers)

**New metrics**:
- **Total customers**: 35 (instead of 20)
- **Traffic spend**: Still $5,000
- **New CPA**: $5,000 ÷ 35 = $142.86 (round to $143)
- **AOV**: Still $150
- **Day zero revenue**: $150
- **Gross profit per customer**: $150 - $143 = **$7**

### Why This Matters

**Physical products**: You'd still lose a small amount due to COGS (cost of goods sold), processing fees, and other expenses. However, you're much more likely to achieve break-even or even scale profitably, whereas the baseline scenario leaves you screwed.

**Info products**: After subtracting processing fees, you might break even or make $1 profit. You'd still want to improve these numbers, but those 15 extra customers from abandoned cart recovery make a huge difference in your ability to scale.

**For copywriters**: Understanding these numbers and economics helps you appreciate why these sequences are valuable to clients.

## Why People Abandon Carts: The 7 Core Reasons

### 1. They Don't Fully Believe Your Solution Solves Their Problem

#### Incomplete Information About Product or Service

**Example from checkout module**: Always include "no subscription" if it's not a subscription. Prospects need complete information.

**Clarion example**: The instructor considered buying but didn't because of trust issues stemming from incomplete information.

**Dr. Queens spray example**: The product page wasn't clear that the small pods go into a spray bottle and replace buying multiple spray bottles, actually saving money. When the instructor reached checkout and saw "one bottle is $20," the thought was: "There's zero percent chance I would buy this. I'm not going to spend $20 on a spray clean bottle, are you kidding me?"

**The problem**: They don't make it super clear. That's on them.

### 2. Negative Past Experiences

**Scenarios**:
- Bought a similar product in the past and didn't get good results
- Bought something they didn't think was a subscription, then it turned out to be a subscription and they had to cancel their card
- Bought things that could have been good solutions, but they didn't use them
- They're worried they won't use this one either
- They're going to "do the same dumb thing and waste money like I always do"

### 3. Lack of Confidence in Themselves

**Internal dialogue examples**:
- "I don't know if I can really do this" (BizOp offer)
- "I can't imagine myself actually making money doing this"
- "Even if I get this supplement, I just don't know if I can stick with it"
- "I always mess things up"
- "I screw things up"
- "I'm not a winner"

### 4. Need for Outside Approval/Validation

**Social pressure concerns**:
- "I'm worried my spouse is going to give me shit if they find out I bought this"
- "They'll tell me I'm a fool: 'You always do this. You always waste money.'"
- "My friends are going to say, 'Oh, this is dumb. That's a pyramid scheme. Why are you trying to do this business thing? Those things are all scams.'"

**The double bind**: "I don't have confidence in myself that if I get this, I'm going to do it. I also don't have confidence without outside validation from other people. I want to know other people are doing this and that it's socially acceptable and smart to do it."

**Note**: This is really helpful to understand when crafting abandoned cart messaging.

### 5. Price Perceived as Too High

**Important distinction**: These are often deeper psychological or educational issues, not purely logical price objections.

**The underlying truth**: If you had really adequately answered reasons #1-4, and if you had truly proven without a shadow of doubt that your solution solves their pain point, and their pain point was urgent enough that they really wanted it solved and would pay almost any amount of money to have it solved, they probably would have bought.

**What "price is too high" really means**:
- The pain point is not severe enough
- They don't believe in the product enough
- Sometimes it's a pure financial constraint (but this is typically rare)

**Financial constraints in context**: In direct-to-consumer marketing, we generally don't focus on people who truly cannot afford something. That's gross territory ("go get a loan, pawn your stuff to buy my course"). However, most people who say "I can't afford it" could afford it if they really wanted it. They'll say they can't afford $200 on your product, then spend $200-$300 at HomeGoods or TJ Maxx on things they also "can't afford."

**The pricing spectrum**:
- **No-brainer price**: They buy without hesitation
- **Investment price**: They have to really think about it: "Do I really want to make this investment?"

### 6. Life Gets in the Way

**By far the easiest person to convert.**

**The scenario**: Someone is on the checkout page, ready to buy, then:
- Gets a phone call
- Kids come home from school early
- Baby starts crying
- Dog starts barking at the front door
- They get up, do other things, and forget what they were doing
- When they come back to it, they're less motivated

**The spell breaks**: Direct response copy often agitates the pain point, presents the solution, and gets prospects mentally to "Yes, I want to buy this." But when life interrupts, the spell breaks. Even though they would have bought, you need to re-sell them and get them back into that frame.

### 7. Lack of Urgency

**Two types of urgency issues**:

#### Pain Point Not Urgent Enough

Not a bleeding neck problem. They're not experiencing enough immediate pain.

**Example**: "Yeah, I have some stains. I'd like to clean my oven, but it's not so urgent. What's going to stop me from getting this next month? I'll come back in a couple weeks and get it. I don't want to spend more money—I already bought a bunch of stuff yesterday on Amazon."

The pain points aren't urgent enough for them to feel they must get the solution immediately.

#### Offer Not Urgent Enough

**Without scarcity**: "Here's the price."

**With scarcity**: "This price is only guaranteed for so long. We may raise prices. New customer discount. Exclusive coupon. Limited time offer."

**Why scarcity works**: If prospects don't feel urgency from the offer itself, they think: "This is cool. I'll save it and come back and get it later."

**What actually happens**: We've all done this. We have the best intentions to buy something. Then time passes, life gets in the way, and urgency and desire go down.

**The time-urgency relationship**:
- Time passes → (Normally) → Urgency and desire decrease

## Real-World Example: The Air Conditioner Story

### The Setup

The instructor's master bedroom air conditioner is on its last legs. A few months ago, service technicians said: "You can just do a new air conditioner. It costs $5,000."

**Initial response**: "I don't want to do that because I don't want to spend $5,000."

**Technician**: "Well, it'll keep working for now."

**Instructor**: "Okay."

**Why no action**: Wasn't urgent enough.

### The Crisis

**Last night**: Woke up kind of hot. AC was set to 69°F, but the temperature was 74°F.

**Thought**: "Fuck, I'm going to have to call these guys. We can't have a super hot room. My wife and I are sleeping in here. Our newborn baby is in the room a lot at night with us."

**Readiness to buy**: Was kind of ready to call them, but didn't do it right away.

**This morning**: Checked again. Temperature went from 74°F down to 72°F. It was cooling, just going really slow.

**Decision**: "Even though yes, I'm going to need to replace that air conditioner, and it's going to cost me $3-4K (don't get hung up on the exact price), I don't want to spend it. But it's kind of working. So I didn't call them. I realistically probably won't call them."

### The Trigger Point

**Hypothetical scenario**: This weekend (Saturday or Sunday—it's Thursday now), the air conditioner goes out completely. It's super hot in the room. Unhappy wife. Can't sleep through the night, or need to put a bunch of fans on.

**Main motivation**: "Mostly unhappy wife. Never want an unhappy wife."

**Suddenly**: It becomes super urgent again.

**Actions taken**:
- "I'm going to call them"
- "I'm going to pay more money"
- "I'll pay an extra $500 for the emergency service"
- "What's the fastest you can do it? Oh my God, I need it right away"

### The Rational vs Actual Behavior

**Rational thinking**: "If I know that's coming in the near future, then theoretically I should just take care of it today before that happens."

**Actual behavior**: "But I'm a human. I don't want to spend the money. So probably I won't."

**The urgency cycle**: You can become urgent enough again. But what if the air conditioning just sort of works? What if it works well for the next couple of months, gets through summer, then the days are cooler and the air conditioning doesn't need to work overtime? It goes into next year.

**Result**: "Even though I know I'm expecting to need to buy a new air conditioner unit within the next week or two, if it randomly works and now the pain point won't be urgent enough for me to take action."

### The Perfect Ad Scenario

**If the instructor woke up this morning (when urgency was high) and the first thing he saw was**:

"Parkland, Florida [his area], air conditioning, top of the line units, white glove delivery, same day, 4th of July sale, 30% off, $2,500. Have your new air conditioner installed—call before 10 a.m. and have your new air conditioner installed before 4 p.m."

**He would have**: "Called them and bought the air conditioner right away because at that moment, the pain point is urgent."

**With lower urgency**: "Now if I saw that ad [after temperature went back down], I'd be like, 'Oh man, wow,' but it's more 50-50. I don't know that I would buy."

**Generic ad without urgency**: "If I just saw an ad that was like 'fourth day air conditioners,' I'm not buying it."

## Framework for Understanding Cart Abandonment

These seven reasons provide a foundation and mindset for creating effective abandoned cart sequences. Understanding the psychology behind why people abandon helps you craft messaging that addresses their specific concerns and brings them back to complete the purchase.

## What's Next

The next video will walk through actual abandoned cart sequences with examples. Subsequent videos will cover:
- Welcome sequences
- Winback sequences
- Promotional sequences

Finally, we'll create a Claude project that can generate all these different email sequences for you.
