# Product-Market Awareness: Overview and Examples

Product-market awareness is a crucial concept that has gained significant importance in modern direct response marketing. While many copywriters are familiar with this framework from Eugene Schwartz's *Breakthrough Advertising*, consciously applying it to every marketing decision represents a fundamental shift in approach—especially critical in 2025.

## The Five Stages of Awareness

### 1. Unaware
Prospects are not even aware of a problem or need that your product or service can solve.

### 2. Problem-Aware
Prospects recognize they have a problem or need, but are unaware of potential solutions.

### 3. Solution-Aware
Prospects know that solutions exist for their problem, but they are not yet aware of your specific solution.

### 4. Product-Aware
Prospects know about your solution (your product or service) and are evaluating its features and benefits.

### 5. Most-Aware
Prospects are highly aware of your solution, its benefits, and are likely to make a purchase decision soon.

## Critical Modification for D2C Brands

The traditional framework defines "product-aware" as knowing about *your specific brand*. However, in the D2C landscape where countless brands exist (many doing a few hundred thousand to even $20-30 million annually), the vast majority of people don't know about your specific product.

**Modified interpretation**: Product-aware means knowing about the *category* of product you sell, not your specific brand.

This distinction is essential because while few people know your brand, many more know the product category (e.g., peptide eye creams, beef tallow skincare, eco-friendly cleaners).

## Why Awareness Level Matters

The awareness level of your target market fundamentally determines:
- Ad copy approach
- Landing page structure
- Amount of education needed
- Type of assets required (advertorial, VSL, simple page)
- Messaging strategy

## The Purchase Probability Hierarchy

**Most likely to buy**: Most-aware (know your brand, researched your approach, read reviews, nearly ready to purchase)

**In a perfect world**, everyone would be at most-aware and your job would be convincing them to get over the hump.

**In reality**, most people are not at most-aware.

## Case Study 1: Peptide Eye Serum (Women 35+)

### Unaware
**Profile**: 38-year-old woman
- Goes about daily routine without noticing fine lines around eyes
- Might catch glimpses in mirror but doesn't register changes or concerns about aging
- Eye cream isn't on her radar
- Uses basic moisturizer, if anything

### Problem-Aware
- Starts noticing crow's feet in photos
- Catches herself in harsh lighting and thinks "When did I start looking so tired?"
- Aware something has changed around her eyes
- Doesn't know what to do about it
- Might mention to friends that she's starting to look old
- Hasn't researched solutions

### Solution-Aware
**The shift happens here**
- Knows eye creams exist and anti-aging treatments are available
- Seen ads for various skincare products
- Knows people use retinol, hyaluronic acid, and cosmetic procedures
- Understands there are ways to address eye aging
- Doesn't know which approach is best or what specific products to consider

### Product-Aware
- Learned about peptides specifically for eye care
- Knows peptide-based eye creams are a category of anti-aging products
- Understands peptides can help with collagen production and fine lines
- Researching different peptide eye creams in general
- Hasn't discovered your specific brand yet

### Most-Aware
- Knows about your specific peptide eye cream brand
- Researched your company's approach
- Understands your unique formulation and benefits
- Read reviews of your products specifically
- Ready to make a purchase decision about your brand versus competitors

## Practical Application: Who to Target

### Total Addressable Market (TAM): 70 million women

**Awareness distribution** (example percentages):
- Unaware: 40%
- Problem-aware: 60%
- Solution-aware: 99% (of women 18+)
- Product-aware: 13.5% (know about peptide eye creams)
- Most-aware: <1% (know your specific brand)

### Key Insight: Overlap Exists

These percentages don't total 100% because there's overlap. Out of the 99% who are solution-aware, a percentage are also product-aware, and a small percentage are most-aware.

**Important distinction**: Almost all women 18+ know that eye creams and anti-aging treatments exist (solution-aware), but not all think they have a problem. Perhaps only 60% are problem-aware.

This means more women are solution-aware than problem-aware—they know solutions exist even if they don't think they have a problem yet.

## Who You're Really Targeting

When selling peptide eye serum to as many people in your TAM as possible, you're typically targeting **problem-aware** prospects.

**Why**:
- They have crow's feet and fine lines
- They're aware of the problem
- They're inherently solution-aware (know skincare exists)
- Your goal: Take them from problem-aware through product-aware to most-aware to buyer

**The Journey**: 4 steps
1. Problem-aware → Solution-aware (often already there)
2. Solution-aware → Product-aware
3. Product-aware → Most-aware
4. Most-aware → Buyer

### Why Not Target Unaware?

The gap from unaware to problem-aware is **significantly larger** than any other gap. Converting unaware prospects requires:
- Branding campaigns
- Traditional advertising (billboards, radio)
- Educational content
- Long-term nurturing

It's not impossible, but it's a lot of work, a long process, and typically not desirable for direct response marketing.

### Why Not Just Target Product-Aware?

While product-aware is a warm audience, it's a smaller group (13.5% vs 60% for problem-aware). You'd be limiting your potential market significantly.

Additionally, your marketing will be completely different when speaking to product-aware versus problem/solution-aware audiences.

## Case Study 2: Sacred Whipped Tallow (Beef Tallow Skincare)

### The Ad That Didn't Work

**Ad copy** (authentic testimonial from the instructor):

"I'm obsessed with this product. If I'm being honest, at first I didn't know what to expect. Like, I'd heard how beef tallow was this hot and trending thing, but the idea of rubbing what's essentially rendered beef fat on my skin was also kind of weird. The second I unscrewed the lid and inhaled the scent of natural vanilla bean extract though, my perception began to change.

And when I used the small golden spoon that accompanied the glass jar, and saw how the tallow folded over itself, kind of like when you get that perfect scoop of ice cream, I couldn't help but feel excited.

Oh, and speaking of feel, let me tell you about the texture. I put the first scoop onto my fingers and I was genuinely surprised by how light and almost fluffy the texture felt. And when I applied it to my cheeks, my forehead, my nose, and underneath my eyes, I loved how it was lightweight and absorbed easily into my skin with no messy residue.

And yet, it stayed on my skin for hours after, giving me this dewy, radiant glow, while keeping my skin feeling supple and soft. Plus, did I mention that smell? It smells like homemade vanilla cupcake frosting. But there's no gross sugary feel on your skin after, and it's not overpowering either.

At this point, I was hooked. I started using it daily, after I'd shower. First I'd apply Opal's Unity Eye Serum around my eyes, then I'd apply Sacred Tallow to the rest of my face. Then, pretty soon, I started applying it to my arms, legs, and chest, too.

It's been over a month now, and I use this product religiously. Plus, I've gotten more compliments on how good my skin looks in the past 30 days than the last 55 years.

My significant other started using it, too, and now we're in this tug-of-war where our jar just goes back and forth between my side of the bathroom and theirs. I even ordered more jars to give to my neighbors and my kids' friends' moms.

Do yourself a favor and try Sacred Whipped Tallow for yourself today.

Just two clean ingredients: premium quality grass-fed tallow and organic vanilla bean, luxurious cloud-like whipped texture that feels like butter and absorbs effortlessly, ethically sourced from grass-fed cows pastured and raised in New Hampshire, no additives, preservatives, hormones, fillers, antibiotics, or other nasty stuff, leaves your skin glowing and looking radiant for hours and hours after each use, and backed by a 180-day money-back guarantee, no returns required, love it or they'll refund every cent.

Right now, you can try it for up to 64% off the normal retail price."

**Note**: This is a completely authentic testimonial. The instructor genuinely loves this product, uses it daily, gets compliments constantly, and shares jars with his wife in a literal tug-of-war over bathroom counter space.

### The Problem: Wrong Awareness Level

This ad made some sales but didn't crush. Why?

**Who the ad targets**: Product-aware people

**Actual market reality**: Solution-aware (at best)

Even though beef tallow for skincare is trending on TikTok, TikTok is still relatively niche. The vast majority of women in the TAM do not know you can use whipped tallow for skin and beauty.

### What's Missing: The Educational Component

When prospects are solution-aware but not product-aware, you need to educate them on **why your product category is the best solution** for their problem.

The ad assumes prospects already know:
- Tallow can make your face glow
- It's really good for your skin
- It contains beneficial fatty acids
- It's a legitimate skincare solution

**Reality**: They're over at solution-aware (know skincare exists) but not at product-aware (don't know tallow is a solution).

### The Fix: Education-Focused Copy

**From advertorial** (addressing the awareness gap):

"Beef tallow is the number one skincare trend on TikTok, but is it a legit miracle moisturizer or just a gross and greasy fad? Here's what you need to know.

**Why So Many Dermatologists Are Actually Recommending Beef Tallow**

'Beef tallow contains fatty acids which help to hydrate the skin, whilst also protecting the skin's main barrier,' explains Dr. Ross Perry at Cosmetic Skin Clinics. 'As a skincare product, it can really help with skin which is overly dry and those who suffer from dry conditions such as psoriasis or eczema.'

According to Dr. Marisa Garshik, board-certified dermatologist at MDCS Dermatology, 'Beef tallow is thought to help your skin dry and boost your natural radiance, thanks to its hydrating and anti-inflammatory properties. Tallow is rich in omega fatty acids to help support the skin barrier. For this reason, it can help moisturize and nourish the skin.'

Dr. Garshik continues, 'Containing linoleic acid, tallow has anti-inflammatory properties to help reduce inflammation and soothe the skin.'

**The Science Is Fascinating**

Beef tallow contains vitamins A, D, K, and E plus essential fatty acids that naturally occur in healthy skin. It's like giving your skin exactly what it already recognizes and craves."

### The Strategic Difference

**Product-aware ad**: Assumes knowledge, focuses on experience and results

**Solution/product awareness bridge**: Educates on why the product category works, establishes credibility with expert opinions, explains science, then leads to product

The education must happen somewhere—in the ad, advertorial, or landing page—to take prospects from solution-aware to product-aware.

## Case Study 3: GLP-1 Medications (Ozempic, Semaglutide) - The Rare Exception

### The Simple Funnel That Works

**Ad**: Simple static ad
- "Get GLP-1 medication"
- "Save $100 off your first month"
- "Get it now"

**Landing page**: Basic information page
- How it works
- Pricing
- Testimonials
- Straightforward purchase flow

**No VSL needed. No advertorial needed.**

### Why This Exception Exists

Almost everyone in the U.S. has:
- Heard of Ozempic
- Heard of Semaglutide
- Heard of GLP-1s
- Knows Ozempic is a GLP-1

**The market is already product-aware.**

### The Journey Comparison

**Normal product** (4 steps):
1. Problem-aware → Solution-aware
2. Solution-aware → Product-aware
3. Product-aware → Most-aware
4. Most-aware → Buyer

**GLP-1 medications** (2 steps):
1. Product-aware → Most-aware
2. Most-aware → Buyer

### What This Means for Copy

Fewer steps = less copy needed

Questions to address:
- What's the cost?
- Can I trust the company?
- How convenient is it?

You don't need a VSL. You don't need an advertorial. Just a clean landing page addressing trust, convenience, and pricing.

## Case Study 4: NAD+ (The Contrasting Mistake)

### The Failed Launch

The instructor's telemedicine company tried launching NAD+ using the same simple funnel that worked for GLP-1s.

**The problem**: Most people haven't heard of NAD+.

NAD+ is:
- An injectable molecule your body makes
- Powers metabolic activity of cells
- Provides cellular energy
- Hyped for anti-aging and longevity

**But the market doesn't know this.**

### Awareness Reality for NAD+

- **Product-aware**: ~13.5% (similar to peptide eye serums)
- **Solution-aware**: ~99% (for anti-aging generally)
- **The gap**: Most people are solution-aware but NOT product-aware about NAD+

### The Results

**Meta ads**: Very poor CPA (Cost Per Acquisition)
- If ads converted at all: $1,000-$2,000 per sale
- Why: Vast majority of people seeing ads don't know enough, aren't educated enough, not enough buyer intent

**Google Search ads**: Good CPA
- ~$250 per sale (good for telemedicine)
- Why: Highly aware people actively searching for NAD+ (most-aware searchers)

### What NAD+ Actually Needs

To work on Meta and cold traffic:
- VSL (video sales letter)
- Really long advertorials
- Extensive education to take prospects from solution-aware → product-aware → most-aware

**Strategic decision**: Too much work for current priorities. Focusing on GLP-1s (bread and butter) and other exciting initiatives instead.

## Case Study 5: Eco-Friendly Cleaning Products

### Unaware
- Busy parent uses whatever cleaning products are cheapest at grocery store
- Doesn't think about ingredients or environmental impact
- Cleans regularly but doesn't consider connection between household cleaners and indoor air quality, skin irritation, or environmental harm

### Problem-Aware
- Notices child's skin reactions after cleaning day
- Reads article about indoor air pollution
- Realizes conventional cleaners might be causing issues in their home
- Doesn't know what alternatives exist

### Solution-Aware
- Learns that green or natural cleaning products exist
- Knows people are switching to safer alternatives
- Sees eco-friendly options in stores
- Feels overwhelmed by choices
- Isn't sure what really works or what to look for

### Product-Aware
- Understands eco-friendly cleaning products are a legitimate category
- Knows about plant-based formulas, non-toxic ingredients, sustainable packaging
- Researching different eco-friendly brands
- Comparing approaches

### Most-Aware
- Knows about your specific eco-friendly cleaning product
- Understands your unique formulation philosophy
- Has read reviews of your product
- Deciding whether to switch from current brand or try your starter kit

### Market Distribution (Estimated)

- **TAM**: 150 million (everyone cleans)
- **Unaware**: 50-70%
- **Problem-aware**: 30% (45 million people)
- **Solution-aware**: 80% of problem-aware
- **Product-aware**: Much smaller subset

### Messaging Differences by Awareness Level

**Problem-Aware**:
"The real reason for your [allergies/brain fog/exhaustion/child's rash]. I had no idea it was all being caused by the cleaner I used in my home."

**Solution-Aware**:
"What's actually in your household cleaner? It causes all these issues... [education on problems with conventional cleaners, why green cleaners are better, do they really work, aren't they expensive]"

**Product-Aware**:
"You're looking for eco-friendly cleaners. Here's why ours is the best: premium ingredients, best price, no toxins. Other eco-friendly cleaners have [problem], ours doesn't."

## Case Study 6: Personal Branding Mastermind (Mid-Level Professionals)

### Unaware
- Just focus on doing good work
- Assume good work leads to career advancement
- Don't think about how they're being perceived professionally
- No consideration of reputation management or personal branding

### Problem-Aware
- Notice colleagues getting promoted over them
- Not being considered for opportunities they feel qualified for
- Realize being good at their job isn't enough
- Something about visibility and perception is holding them back

### Solution-Aware
- Learn that personal branding is a thing
- Understand professionals actively work on reputation, LinkedIn presence, thought leadership
- Recognize this could help career
- Don't know how to approach it strategically

### Product-Aware
- Know that personal branding courses, masterminds, coaching programs exist
- Familiar with concept of building thought leadership, creating content, networking strategically
- Researching different educational options

### Most-Aware
- Found your specific personal branding mastermind
- Understand your methodology and community approach
- Reviewed curriculum and success stories
- Ready to invest in your program specifically (with a little push)

### Market Distribution (Estimated)

- **Problem-aware**: 30% of TAM
- **Solution-aware**: 10% (much smaller—many problem-aware people blame boss/manager/company instead of lack of personal branding)
- **Product-aware**: 5%

### Messaging Differences

**Problem-Aware**:
"You're noticing you're getting passed over. You're working hard, but it's not enough. [Introduce personal branding as solution they hadn't considered]"

**Solution-Aware**:
"Ever notice how some colleagues suddenly have a meteoric rise? They're being invited to speak at company and vendor conferences. They're being looked at as a thought leader. They're on the fast track for success. It's all because they built a personal brand. But maybe it sounds like a lot of work, or you're not sure if that's for you, or you don't know what that would even entail. Well, guess what? It's actually really easy. I'm going to show you how..."

**Product-Aware**:
"You probably know how important personal brand is these days, even if you're in a steady traditional 9-to-5 type of job. You've seen colleagues who have had miraculous rises. You've seen how they get invited to speak. You've seen how they're on a fast track to C-level leadership. You're thinking you want the same thing. You're not exactly sure where to start. Maybe you've even looked at a few programs—coaching, masterminds. Well, I'm going to show you exactly the easiest way to do this with [your system]..."

### Important Gap: Problem-Aware to Solution-Aware

In this market, there's a significant gap between problem-aware and solution-aware.

Many 9-to-5 workers who are frustrated about being passed over for promotions don't think personal branding is the answer. They think:
- Their boss sucks
- Their manager sucks
- Their company doesn't give them mobility

**Implication**: Of the 30% who are problem-aware, maybe only 10% are actually thinking about personal branding as a solution. Of that 10%, maybe half know about courses/masterminds/coaching programs.

### Scaling Strategy

If you want to go mass-market and scale, you need to target problem-aware prospects, not just the small percentage who are already solution/product-aware.

**BizOp Example Parallel**:
Many BizOp marketers write copy targeting product-aware people: "You've probably tried Amazon FBA programs, you've worked with coaches..."

To go truly mass-market at higher scale, you must target problem-aware: The average 9-to-5 person who wants economic freedom and flexibility but has no idea about FBA or other specific solutions.

**Exception**: BizOp can sometimes tap into unaware because the desire for more freedom and money is universal. Showing the right opportunity might agitate a latent problem.

## The Fundamental Principle

**Who you are speaking to and what level of awareness you're targeting with your copy and marketing efforts is crucially important.**

This understanding drives:
- How your copy is created
- Which assets you need (VSL, advertorial, simple page)
- How much education to include
- What messaging resonates
- Which pain points to emphasize
- What objections to address

Throughout RMBC2, we'll continuously return to this concept when examining different copy examples, because awareness level makes all the difference in copy strategy and execution.

## Next Module: Deep Research Process

The next section will demonstrate how to use deep research (primarily with Perplexity) to get specific answers about awareness levels for any market:
- Estimating TAM (Total Addressable Market)
- Determining awareness distribution percentages
- Understanding market sophistication
- Identifying key differentiators
- Discovering what prospects actually know vs. what you assume they know

This research process saves time and maximizes probability of success by ensuring you're targeting the right awareness level with appropriate messaging.
