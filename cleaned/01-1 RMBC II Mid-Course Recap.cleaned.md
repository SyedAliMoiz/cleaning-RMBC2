# RMBC II Mid-Course Recap

This mid-course recap provides a zoomed-out view of what you've covered so far and simplifies the overall process. Given the size and complexity of RMBC2, this overview helps clarify the journey and connect all the pieces.

## What We've Covered So Far

### 1. Introduction and Foundations
- Overview of copywriting and how it's applied in 2025
- The journey from Point A (Prospect) to Point B (Customer)
- Platform-specific copy considerations
- Fundamentals of direct response copywriting
- Course organization and what to expect

### 2. Deep Research (3-4 Steps)

**Product and Market Awareness**
- Understanding what stage of awareness your prospect is at
- Tailoring messaging and copy based on awareness level
- Critical for VSLs and all other marketing assets (ads, etc.)

**Competitor Research**
- Analyzing competitive landscape
- Understanding what competitors claim and how they position

**Psychographic Research**
- Deep psychological drivers of target customers
- Understanding hopes, dreams, fears, and motivations

**Ingredient Research** (for supplement copywriters)
- Using perplexity for deep ingredient research
- Finding studies, claims, and citations

**Output**: Unified Research Document combining all research elements

### 3. Unique Mechanisms

**Process covered**:
- Overview of unique mechanisms
- UM ideation with LLMs (excellent prompts that deliver real results)
- Evaluating multiple mechanism options with LLMs
- Expanding selected mechanism into copy format using Claude projects

**Real-world validation**: This process was recently used for a CA Pro member's VSL project. It generated several strong mechanisms, including one that was instantly the favorite. When run through different LLMs along with other strong options, all selected the same mechanism—perfect confirmation.

**Output**: Selected unique mechanism with document in expanded copy format

### 4. VSL Part 1: Structure and Theory (Intermezzo)

**Why this section exists**: Understanding what VSL copy looks like and the component parts helps you create better briefs and generate better copy.

**What's included**:
- VSL structure training (some from 6 months ago, some new)
- Long-form VSL structure
- Medium-form VSL structure
- Short-form VSL structure (new content)
- Specific VSL example breakdowns
- Medium-form VSL breakdowns (3-7 minute range)
- Short VSL breakdowns
- Hooks training
- ADHD hook video ads (3-7 minute VSL range with specific characteristics)
- In-feed vs on-page VSLs

**Nature**: Mostly passive learning—understanding theory and structure

### 5. Briefs 2.0

**Critical importance**: This may have the fewest bullets in the outline, but it's essential for RMBC 2.0. If you skipped this section, go back and complete it.

**What it provides**: The comprehensive document you need to generate all copy types

**Output**: Expanded Brief 2.0 with everything needed for copy generation

### 6. VSL Copy Part 2: Active Creation

**What's included**:
- Setting up Claude projects for different VSL lengths
- VSL creation walkthroughs and examples
- Long-form examples: Financial offer, UDI eye serum, blood sugar supplement, Airbnb arbitrage
- Medium-form examples: Blood sugar, Unity eye serum, Airbnb arbitrage
- 3-7 minute examples: Blood sugar, Unity (2 examples)
- Short VSL examples: All four example products
- Hook generation processes

**Output**: Finished VSL(s) with multiple leads and hooks

**Important note**: In RMBC2, "VSLs" includes 2-minute VSLs that function as Meta ads. The line between VSLs and video ads has blurred significantly.

## The Simplified RMBC Process

### Step 1: Research
**Process**: Product-market awareness, competitor research, psychographic research, ingredient research

**Output**: Unified Research Document

### Step 2: Mechanism
**Process**: Ideation, evaluation, selection, expansion

**Output**: Selected unique mechanism document in expanded copy format

### Step 3: Brief
**Process**: Brief creation using Claude projects

**Output**: Expanded Brief 2.0 with all necessary elements

### Step 4: Copy
**Process**: VSL generation using Claude projects, multiple iterations

**Output**: Finished VSL with multiple leads and hooks

## The Most Important Takeaway: Feedback and Iteration

**This is not a static process.** It's not simply: put stuff in → get outputs → done.

**The biggest component**: Giving feedback, iterating, and copy-chiefing.

### Why Watch All VSL Examples

Each VSL example walkthrough is different and teaches important lessons:

**Long-form examples** (foundational): Start here

**All examples teach different scenarios**:
- Cases where Claude stopped working, so Gemini was used instead
- Blood sugar long-form example (especially important): Had doctor-specific VSL version and hero's journey spokesperson version, decided on doctor version, realized there was no big idea or hook, ideated with Claude in the project to get big idea and hook, updated brief, wrote copy, ingredient section was weak, expanded ingredients to strengthen
- Real-time copy-chiefing in Claude projects with explanation of reasoning
- Short VSL examples showing hook generation and big idea development
- Airbnb arbitrage hook generation
- Financial offer hook generation (perplexity process didn't work well, figured out different approach)

### Becoming a Scientist and Experimenter

**Encouraged approach**:
- Try your own things
- Experiment with variations
- Communicate with Claude and LLMs
- Give feedback to improve outputs
- Test different approaches

**Not necessary**: Messing up all the provided projects or processes

**The key**: Using your best judgment and maintaining perspective

## Quality Assurance: Your Copy Will Be Better Than 99% of Copywriters

**Important perspective when you feel overwhelmed**: If you actually follow these processes closely, the copy you generate will be better than what 99% of copywriters would write—even experienced ones, even people who post on Twitter and Facebook acting like experts.

### The Reality of Copywriter Quality

Copy quality from self-proclaimed experts is often:
- Mid-level
- Sometimes really bad
- Occasionally good
- Very inconsistent
- Basic things get missed

### The Few Elite Copywriters (Who Beat This Process)

**Hard to hire (if available at all)**:
- Mario Castelli (really hard to hire)
- Luke Millis (doesn't really write copy anymore)
- Dan Ferrari (great, but hard to get)
- Chris Zadeh (great copywriter, unsure if still writing regularly)
- Chris Wright (used to be good, unsure if writes regularly now)
- Jason Strachan (pretty good)
- Steve Earle (really good, but usually not available)
- Kate Vidalucci (written great copy over the years, unsure what she's doing currently)

**The honest assessment**: It's almost impossible to recommend copywriters because there's only a handful of people who consistently write great copy every single time.

**What this process delivers**: Copy that will be better than pretty much anybody and as good as what the elite copywriters write on most of their days. Dan, Mario, and Luke (when he was writing) will still beat you, but that's a handful of people.

**Bottom line**: Don't worry if you start getting overwhelmed. Accept what you've got—it's excellent.

**For business owners**: Join CA Pro and get personal copy review and modification assistance.

## The Big Picture

You've completed the core RMBC process:
1. **Research** → Unified Research Document
2. **Mechanism** → Selected mechanism in expanded copy format
3. **Brief** → Expanded Brief 2.0
4. **Copy** → Finished VSL(s) with multiple leads and hooks

This foundation enables you to create any type of copy with the same systematic approach. The remaining sections apply this foundation to different marketing assets and situations.

The next section covers advertorials, continuing your journey through the complete RMBC2 system.
