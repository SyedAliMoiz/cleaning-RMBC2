# Welcome to RMBC II: In-Depth Overview

Welcome to RMBC2. This overview provides a comprehensive roadmap of what's inside the course and how it's organized. Rather than endless superlatives, you'll experience the value yourself as you progress through the material.

## Course Philosophy: Copy Thinker vs Copywriter

RMBC2 represents a fundamental shift in how we approach copywriting in 2025. You're no longer primarily a copywriter—you're a **copy thinker**. Using AI (primarily Claude and LLMs), you become the commander and copy chief. AI handles the heavy writing while you:

- Direct strategy and provide feedback
- Request game plans and outlines
- Evaluate and refine copy
- Make strategic decisions about messaging

This approach is faster, more efficient, and allows you to create any type of copy once you understand the underlying theory and processes.

## Part 1: Foundations

This essential module sets up everything that follows. It covers:

### Core Concepts
- What is copywriting and direct response copywriting
- Sales funnels in 2025
- Why context is king
- Broad overview of the RMBC2 approach

### The Importance of Context

Context operates on multiple levels throughout RMBC2:

**Platform-Specific Context**: The customer journey from unawareness to purchase differs across platforms (Meta vs Native) and varies based on what you're selling, pricing, and other factors.

**Product and Market Awareness**: How you sell to someone who knows your product exists differs dramatically from selling to someone vaguely aware of their problem but not actively seeking solutions. Understanding these awareness levels is fundamental to writing effective copy and converting prospects to customers.

## Part 2: Deep Research

The research process consists of four core steps, with an additional section on ingredient research for supplement copywriters.

### Product-Market Awareness Research
- Understanding what it is and why it matters
- Deep research process for analyzing product-market awareness
- Applicable to any product or service

### Competitive Research
- Creating comprehensive competitor analysis documents
- Understanding competitor claims at specific awareness levels
- Identifying what prospects like and dislike about competitor products
- Understanding the competitive landscape even when prospects aren't aware of your specific offering

### Psychographic Research
- The original "R" in RMBC
- Deep psychological drivers of your target customer
- Research contextualized by product and market awareness levels
- This research heavily influences all copy, especially VSLs

### Creating the Unified Research Document

At the end of the research process, you'll have three separate documents:
1. Product-market awareness research
2. Competitor research
3. Psychographic research

These combine into one unified research document—your ultimate reference containing everything about product-market awareness, customer likes and dislikes, psychological drivers, hopes, dreams, and pain points. This document becomes the foundation for all great copy.

### Ingredient Research (Supplements)

For those writing supplement copy, there's a deep research prompt (typically using Perplexity) to gather studies, claims, and citations. What used to take hours now takes less than five minutes.

## Part 3: Mechanisms

### Understanding Unique Mechanisms
- Overview of what unique mechanisms are
- Why they matter in copywriting

### AI Processes for Mechanism Development
- Ideation with large language models
- Using deep research to generate strong mechanism ideas
- Examples across multiple niches: eye serum (skincare), Airbnb arbitrage (high-ticket coaching), supplements, and more

### Evaluating and Selecting Mechanisms
- Process for using LLMs to evaluate multiple mechanism options
- Selecting the best mechanism for your offer
- Particularly valuable for newer copywriters or when choosing between strong options

### Expanding Mechanisms into Copy
- How to expand mechanism ideas into copy format
- Claude project setup for writing out unique mechanisms
- Understanding why expansion matters

## Part 4: VSL Core Training

Before creating briefs and generating copy, you need to understand VSL structure with the end in mind.

### Modern VSL Landscape

VSLs in 2025 differ from the original RMBC focus. While 15-50 minute VSLs still exist, modern VSLs include:
- **Long-form**: Traditional 15-50+ minute VSLs
- **Medium-length**: 6-18 minutes, often running as Meta ads in feeds
- **Short-form**: 3-7 minutes
- **Video ads**: 1.5-2 minutes (VSL/video ad formats increasingly overlap for Meta)

### Core VSL Components
- Overview of VSL structure
- Breakdown of leads and different sections
- Step-by-step walkthroughs

### Specific VSL Examples and Breakdowns

**Essential viewing** (especially for newer practitioners):
- Neuro VSL breakdown
- MiamiMD VSL breakdown
- Both medium-length examples highly recommended

Additional examples:
- Long-form VSL breakdowns
- Short-form VSL examples
- ADHD hook video ads (3-7 minute effective format with breakdowns from VShred, Svelte, and others)

### Additional Training
- In-depth hooks training
- Difference between in-feed and on-page VSLs (critical understanding)
- Claude project for generating hooks

**Note for experienced practitioners**: While you may be knowledgeable about VSLs, the examples and breakdowns provide value and may be referenced later in the course.

## Part 5: Brief 2.0

The Brief 2.0 represents a dramatically expanded version from RMBC1.

### Evolution from RMBC1

**Old brief**: Simple one-page reference with target market, product, mechanism.

**New Brief 2.0**: Comprehensive 25-point document containing:
- Demographics and psychographics
- Pain points and emotional states
- Big promises and emotional empowerment
- Existing solutions and their shortcomings
- Unique mechanism with nicknames
- Ingredients, studies, and scientific backing
- Bold claims and emotional transformation
- Product benefits and fascinations
- Unique differentiators and background story
- Speaker and expert credentials
- Brand details and testimonials
- Credibility builders and medical endorsements
- Industry recognition
- Pricing structure (normal retail vs actual price)
- Multi-option savings and guarantees
- Scarcity elements and future pacing
- Expected results timeline
- Objections with answers
- Specific hooks to test

### Brief Generation Process

Using Claude projects, you can:
- Generate comprehensive briefs from research documents, mechanism work, and product information
- Create briefs from existing product pages
- Generate briefs using only ingredient research with placeholders
- Produce multiple brief variations (e.g., ClickBank-style customer story vs doctor-led approach)

This brief becomes your master document for generating all copy types: VSLs, ads, advertorials, email sequences, and more.

## Part 6: Copy Generation - VSLs

With your brief created, you're ready to generate copy using Claude projects.

### VSL Projects Available
- Long VSLs
- Medium-length VSLs (6-18 minutes)
- Three to seven-minute VSLs
- Short VSLs and video ads

### Generation Process
1. Provide the brief to the Claude project
2. Request VSL creation
3. Review the outline
4. Request revisions as needed
5. Generate final copy
6. Copy chief, provide feedback, and tweak

The copy quality is strong out of the gate, but your role as copy chief—providing feedback and strategic direction—elevates it further.

## Mid-Course Recap

After covering research, mechanisms, VSLs, briefs, and copy generation, there's a comprehensive recap to help you see the simplified overall process. The course intentionally goes deep into details, and this recap helps you emerge with clarity about the streamlined RMBC2 approach.

## Part 7: Advertorials

### Understanding Advertorials
- Purpose and use cases
- When to use long vs short advertorials
- Customer journey: ad → advertorial → destination

### Advertorial Destinations

Where advertorials lead and why:
- Direct to checkout page

- Understanding when to use short vs long product pages
- How to use AI to create outlines from winning PDP structures
- Claude project for instantly generating new product pages

## Part 9: Checkouts

While not a lengthy module, checkout understanding is important and valuable.

### Checkout Variation Analysis

**Example 1**: Emma (digestive supplement) - Direct to contact information and purchase

**Example 2**: Dr. Clean - Extensive content before product selection, with additional content after

Understanding why these checkouts differ (within the context of the complete customer journey) ensures you design optimal checkout experiences.

### Training Components
- Desktop and mobile checkout analysis
- Strategic reasoning for checkout variations
- Context of entire customer journey
