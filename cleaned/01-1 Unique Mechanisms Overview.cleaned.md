# Unique Mechanisms: Overview and Examples

## Who Should Watch This Video

**If you've seen previous unique mechanism trainings** from the instructor, you can likely skip this specific video. It provides broad-level reminders and examples of what UMPs and UMSs are.

**Do not skip subsequent videos**, which cover specific AI processes for leveraging LLMs to generate unique mechanism ideas across different niches (health, BizOp, and others). Those videos will demonstrate how unified research, product-market awareness, and other elements integrate into mechanism selection.

**If you're new to unique mechanisms**, this video provides essential foundational understanding.

## What Are Unique Mechanisms?

Unique mechanisms were popularized by the instructor in 2018-2019 and are now well-known in the copywriting world. The core concept hasn't changed since RMBC1.

### Definition

The unique mechanism explains:
1. **Why our prospect is struggling or suffering to achieve a goal**
2. **How they can overcome that problem**

At its core, the unique mechanism is a **two-part logical connection**.

## The Two Parts: UMP and UMS

### UMP: Unique Mechanism of the Problem

The unique mechanism behind the problem that our prospect faces.

### UMS: Unique Mechanism of the Solution

The unique mechanism behind the solution to that problem.

## Why Unique Mechanisms Matter

### The Prospect's Journey

By the time prospects come to us, they've usually tried numerous solutions for their problem already:
- Past solutions may not have worked at all
- They may have worked partially
- They may have worked fully for a period before they stopped working

### Our Job as Copywriters

Educate prospects about the **real reason** why past solutions didn't bring permanent results.

**How we do this**: Explain that their knowledge about the problem is incomplete. They've been missing one crucial piece of information—a knowledge gap that's been holding them back.

### The Power of the Two-Part Connection

**By showing them the UMP (unique mechanism behind the problem)**:
- You get the prospect to understand why they failed in the past

**By showing them the UMS (unique mechanism behind the solution)**:
- You get the prospect to believe that our product will bring them success where other alternatives have failed

## Connection to Product-Market Awareness

Unique mechanisms tie directly into the product-market awareness framework covered earlier in the course.

### Awareness Levels Impact Mechanism Strategy

**Important consideration**: Even as you develop unique mechanisms, keep in mind where your prospect is on their journey. What level of awareness are they at?

### Example: NAD+ vs General Energy Support

**Scenario 1 - Product-Aware Market (Small Segment)**:
- Prospects familiar with NAD+ specifically
- Have tried NAD+ products and haven't gotten results
- Unique mechanism addresses why other NAD+ products didn't work

**Scenario 2 - Problem/Solution-Aware Market (Larger Segment)**:
- Feeling tired frequently
- Have low energy
- Feel like they look old and tired
- Want more energy and longevity support
- Don't want to feel like they're getting old
- Unique mechanism addresses why conventional energy solutions haven't worked

**Key insight**: The unique mechanism must be tailored to the awareness level. This is why product-market awareness flavors everything we do.

## Real-World Example 1: MiamiMD (Crepey Skin)

### Background

MiamiMD is a skincare company that has been around for a long time. Peter Kell was one of the founders. They were in CA Pro when getting off the ground, and Peter is still in CA Pro today.

### The Advertorial

**Headline**: "Harvard Dermatologist reveals the hidden cause of crepey skin is not collagen loss"

### The Problem Setup

"Crepey skin is often considered just an inevitable part of aging, difficult to disguise and impossible to get rid of. But now, world-renowned dermatologist Dr. J says that's simply not true."

### Introducing the Knowledge Gap

"She explains, crepey skin is one of the most common signs of aging, but it's not something women have to put up with. According to top experts, the reason why crepey skin won't go away is not because it's an impossible feat. It's because most methods and skincare products don't treat the real root cause."

### The UMP (Unique Mechanism of Problem)

**What they thought**: "Everyone likes to tell us the loss of collagen is causing thin, crepey skin"

**The real cause**: "But it's actually your failing fibroblasts that cause the skin structure to collapse and become crepey"

**Explanation**: "In simple terms, fibroblasts are like your skin's interior designers. They live in the hidden second layer of your skin, the dermis, and their main job is to design and construct your skin to look at its best. But as we age, they start to get lazy. Now, the once tight, firm complexion they held together begins to fall apart. The result? Thin, loose, crepey skin that we attempt to reverse, but with all the wrong methods."

### The UMS (Unique Mechanism of Solution)

"But there's good news. Once you recharge your fibroblasts, they can work their very best again, allowing your skin to become smoother, tighter, and firmer."

### The Missing 1%

- **You thought it was**: Collagen loss
- **It's actually**: Failing fibroblasts
- **Fibroblasts get lazy** → Crepey skin develops
- **Solution**: Recharge your fibroblasts → Skin becomes smoother, tighter, and firmer

### Context: Advertorial Strategy

The job of an advertorial (especially when leading to a VSL) is typically to sell the click—more specifically, to sell the **qualified click**.

**Important distinction**: We don't want a man not interested in crepey skin clicking through. We want someone who would be a qualified prospective buyer within our target market to click through.

**Why mechanisms can be simpler in advertorials**: You don't need to give every single detail about the unique mechanism in an advertorial because prospects will see much more detail in the VSL. Right now, you just need to talk about the part they've been missing—that missing 1%.

## Real-World Example 2: Unity Eye Serum (Instructor's Product)

### Background

This is a product page (Shopify e-commerce page), not an advertorial or VSL. An advertorial like the MiamiMD example might lead to a product page like this instead of to a VSL.

**Performance note**: This mechanism is actually working pretty well, but the instructor wants to test other mechanisms for this product.

### The Headline Promise

"Skin unifying serum fades the appearance of crow's feet, dark circles, and eye bags all at once."

### The Micro Summary

"This breakthrough formula is designed to penetrate deep into the dermal-epidermal junction where eye aging begins. The special blend of six powerful ingredients supports this crucial connection between skin layers, giving you an all-in-one eye serum that transforms your eye area."

**Astute observation**: This summary is actually a micro version of the UMP and UMS:
- There's a thing called the dermal-epidermal junction (DEJ)
- That's where eye aging begins (UMP)
- If you support those crucial connections between skin layers, you'll have better skin (UMS)
- Logical connection: Problem → Solution

### The Detailed Explanation

**Section headline**: "The hidden reason why your eyes may be aging faster than you want and why most eye serums fail"

**The Problem**: "If you're frustrated by stubborn crow's feet, persistent dark circles, and sagging that makes you look tired all the time, it's not your fault. All of these issues begin when the layers of your skin begin to separate. The separation forms in the dermal-epidermal junction, the area where your layers of skin meet, and most eye serums and creams do not address this issue at all."

**Young, Healthy Skin**: "In healthy skin, the top and bottom layers are deeply interconnected and unified together, like two pieces of fabric joined by microscopic hooks. When your skin is young and wrinkle-free, these hooks form a wavy-like interconnection between the two layers. These crucial connections help maintain youthful skin in several ways:
- They allow nutrients to flow freely to your skin surface
- They help remove toxins and waste
- They keep skin firm, supple, and evenly toned
- They maintain skin's youthful balance and elasticity"

**Aging Skin Breakdown**: "But as we age, something devastating happens. These vital connections begin to break down, and those hooks disappear. Eventually, your skin layers become completely separated, especially around your delicate eye area. The result?
- Nutrients can't reach your skin's surface
- Dark circles appear as blood vessels become more visible
- Skin begins to collapse inward, forming wrinkles and crow's feet
- Fluid accumulates, creating puffy under-eye bags
- Skin loses its firm, youthful appearance"

**Visual representation**: Young skin shows wavy, interconnected layers. Old skin shows compressed, collapsed separation.

### The Solution

"Introducing Unity Eye Serum. Instead of just moisturizing the surface, our breakthrough formula penetrates deep into the dermal-epidermal junction, supporting the crucial connection between your skin layers."

### The Logical Connection

**UMP**: You have a layer within your skin called the dermal-epidermal junction (DEJ). It's wavy and hooked/intertwined, keeping layers connected. As you age, it unhooks. Separation occurs. Skin collapses in on itself. You see eye bags, wrinkles, dark circles.

**UMS**: If you can redo the hooks and reconnect your skin layers, there's no chasm creating wrinkles, fine lines, and dark circles.

**Note**: The mechanism could be stated more clearly on the page. This might be a future test.

## Real-World Example 3: Emma Relief (Digestive Health)

### Background

This is a really nice e-commerce page with video.

### The Mechanism Approach

Emma Relief doesn't have a crazy hard mechanism push. They have a mechanism that's shared through a few different places on the page.

### The UMP Section

**Headline**: "The surprising root cause of bloating and constipation"

**Three-step problem explanation**:

**Step 1 - Bad bacteria takes hold**: "Stress, antacids, antibiotics, and artificial sweeteners weaken your defenses, allowing pathogenic bacteria, parasites, or archaea (single-cell organisms) to take hold."

**Step 2 - Bacteria produces methane gas**: "The bad bacteria begin to release methane gas, which causes bloating and constipation."

**Step 3 - Digestion slows down**: "Methane gas damages the sensitive nerves of the gut, slowing the movement of food through the intestines. This slows or even halts your pooping and elimination."

### The UMS Section

**Headline**: "Stop production of methane gas at the source"

**Three-way solution**: "It works in three different ways to normalize bathroom habits, usually within a few weeks of taking it, to eliminate constipation and bring back those perfect poops daily:
1. Increases motility (aka pooping speed)
2. Clears up the bacteria that causes methane gas
3. Calms the nerves and relaxes tight muscles that allow for easy passage"

### The Core Mechanism

**What people know**: Bad bacteria is in your gut

**The missing 1%**: That bad bacteria creates methane gas

**The UMP**: Methane gas causes bloating, constipation, and slows your digestion. It leaves poop stuck in your gut. You're constipated and feeling gross.

**The UMS**: Stop the production of methane gas at the source.

**Simplicity**: It's pretty straightforward and effective.

## Real-World Example 4: Performance Golf Driver

### Background

This is from one of their "caveman pages" (glorified FAQ page) for a driver product.

### The Product

Slice-fixing driver technology

### Market Awareness Context

**Important note**: Most golfers in the market know some stuff. They know that an open club face relative to the path of your swing at impact is what causes a slice.

### The UMP

**What is it?**: "What fixes your slice? It fixes your slice at impact."

**Why is that important?**: "An open face relative to the path is the one and only reason you slice."

**The real root cause** (note on language): "The real root cause of your slice is an open club face relative to the path of your swing at impact. Most players know that."

**Side note on "root cause" language**: In health and wellness, you're really not supposed to claim one thing is the root cause (that's diagnostic language). But everyone does it in health anyway. With golf, it doesn't matter at all because there's no regulatory concern.

### The Solution Landscape

"The bottom line is all slice-fix training, draw-bias clubs, and virtually every training aid all attempt to do the same thing: square your club face relative to the path at impact."

### The UMS

"This new driver squares the face for you without needing any training."

**What this means**:
- You don't have to aim way left
- You don't have to play an offset driver
- You don't need to do anything else

**Why offset drivers fail**: "When you set up to the ball with an offset driver and its closed face is aiming left, you naturally tend to readjust the face and align with the target. The problem is, that means you're actually opening the face. When you open the face even before you start your swing, your chances of getting it back to square at impact are damn near zero."

### The Interesting Angle

**They're not saying other solutions are wrong.** They're saying there's training involved, and if you do training, you're thinking about too much stuff. You're trying to do all these other things, and you end up slicing anyway.

**This driver does it for you.**

**The problem reframed**:
- You know what to do
- When you try to do what you know, you make mistakes
- There are physiological things happening
- Other tricks and things people teach you don't work

**The solution**: Don't try to do anything. The club just does it automatically.

### Technical Delivery

The rest of the page includes product features and benefits, FAQ answers, and more detail about the technical components that enable the driver to fulfill its promise of "doing it for you."

## The Simple Formula

### It's Not Rocket Science

Unique mechanisms don't have to be overly complex, especially depending on context. It really comes down to:

**Problem → Solution**

### The Essential Questions

1. **What's the real reason they haven't found a solution yet?**
2. **What's really causing the problem that's different from what they think?**
3. **If that's the real cause, what's the solution?**

**The answer**: The solution is to address the real cause.

**It's really as simple as that.**

## Universal Applicability

Unique mechanisms apply to virtually all copy types:

- **VSLs** (all lengths)
- **TSLs** (text sales letters)
- **PDPs** (product pages)
- **Advertorials** (often)
- **Ads** (often)

They're universally applicable to anything you're doing to get someone from Point A (prospect) to Point B (buyer).
