# The Old Brief vs The New Brief: Overview

Welcome to the Brief section of RMBC2. If you recall the RMBC framework—**Research, Mechanism, Brief, Copy**—you've now completed research and mechanisms, and you're moving on to the brief. This section is imperative for writing great copy.

## Critical Importance

The brief is:
- **Especially imperative** for long-form VSLs
- **Also imperative** for medium-form VSLs
- **Very useful** for short-form VSLs
- **Applicable** to PDPs, advertorials, and other copy types

**Do not skip this section.** In RMBC1, people who didn't do long-form copy sometimes skipped the brief or underappreciated its value. The brief is essential for all serious copywriting.

## The Fundamental Difference

### The Old Brief (RMBC1)

**Purpose**: Getting information onto paper that you, a human, would need to write copy (especially long-form, but also medium-form and other formats)

**How it worked**: Asks questions you need to answer in order to write the copy yourself

**Who fills it out**: You do, manually

**Who uses it**: You use it to write copy yourself

### The New Brief (Brief 2.0)

**Purpose**: Creating a comprehensive document to give to an LLM (Large Language Model) to write copy

**How it works**: More in-depth questions, but with detailed instructions for the LLM

**Who fills it out**: You don't—Claude generates it from your research and inputs

**Who uses it**: Claude (or other LLMs) use it to generate copy

**Important note**: You can still use this to write copy yourself if you're resistant to AI copy generation. However, the system is optimized for LLM-based copywriting.

## The Classic Brief (RMBC1) - Quick Review

While many questions from the classic brief appear in Brief 2.0, here's a quick overview of the original structure:

### 1. Who is the audience?
Who's the target market you're speaking to?

### 2. What are their big pain points or fears?
- Being broke, not having enough money
- Being overweight
- Having blood sugar issues
- Having low energy
- Not feeling confident
- Not getting romantic partners
- Whatever the core problem is

### 3. Short-term and long-term consequences
**Long-term dimensionalized version**:
"Ending up alone for the rest of your life. Your mother was right that you're really a disappointment. This is another Saturday night, you're staring at your phone on the couch by yourself, and that thought hits: I guess it's going to be all alone again."

This dimensionalization makes pain points more vivid and emotionally resonant.

### 4. What's the big promise?
By reversing the pain points and biggest fears, what's the big promise they're going to get from interacting with the copy?

**Distinction**: This is different from a promise around the product itself. It's more like:
- "You're going to discover a breakthrough solution that can help lower blood sugar"
- "Help you burn fat"
- "An easy paint-by-number system that can help you bring in more income"

### 5. What solutions for the reader's problem already exist?
Why aren't they working?

This ties directly to the competitor research section.

### 6. What's the unique mechanism?
- Mechanism of solution
- Mechanism of the problem

**Format**: Write it out in copy format so when you go to write a sales letter or any sales copy, you already have the mechanism explained. You don't have to think of how to present it while writing—you've already prepared the presentation.

### 7. Metaphors (Optional)
Examples of metaphors that could make the mechanism or concept more understandable.

**Note**: AI is quite good at metaphors these days, so you don't need to come up with these as much. If you have a great one, cool. But Brief 2.0 doesn't emphasize this.

### 8. What they're going to get from using the product
When you use the product, you're going to:
- Start earning $500-$800 a month of extra income
- Start burning fat around the clock
- Feel sexier and more confident

This is what's going to happen with the product.

### 9. What is the product?
Features and benefits, or physical attributes

**For informational products**: Sometimes use fascinations (curiosity bullets)
- "Inside the book, you'll discover the one thing you should never say to a police officer if you want to get out of a ticket"
- "Five words to never say to a beautiful woman at the bar if you want to get her number"
- "The handsome guy approach that works every time"

These fascinations sell the product by teasing what's inside.

**For coaching programs**: Outline each module of the program

### 10. Background story / Story of discovery
The classic hero's journey:
- Somebody like me, or somebody close to me, or somebody I know was in pain (starting with this pain point)
- They went on a journey and found the solution

**Examples**:
- Exhausted mom finds energy solution
- Doctor sees patients all struggling with this pain point and tries to figure out the real cause
- Guy working 9-to-5, feeling stress from bills, decides to quit and start dropshipping

### 11. Headline ideas
Potential headlines to test

### 12. Potential upsells
Don't stress too much about this—you'll worry about it later in the course.

## The New Brief (Brief 2.0) - Detailed Breakdown

Many elements from the classic brief appear here, but with important additions and modifications for LLM use.

### 1. Who is the audience?
Same as classic brief.

### 2. What are their pain points?
Same as classic brief.

### 3. Reversing the pain points (big promises)
**New framing**: "These are promises for what they'll get from interacting with the sales copy, or for teasing the solution you'll be showing them in the sales copy."

Instruction helps the LLM understand the purpose.

### 4. What does it look like when the prospect's pain points have been solved?
**Include four dimensions**:
- **Physical**: Blood sugar levels are lower, burning fat and building muscle, physical transformation
- **Emotional**: Feel more confident, proud, empowered
- **Social**: Friends notice and ask questions, compliments from others
- **Psychological**: Feel bold, sharper, the nagging voice in the back of your head dies

**Why this matters**: Painting this picture is powerful in direct response oriented copy. Future pacing transforms abstract benefits into concrete, lived experiences.

**Note on duplication**: This question appears twice in Brief 2.0 with slight variations. It may seem redundant but serves the brief structure.

### 5. Solutions really talked about (existing solutions and why they fail)
Covered in your research, so you already have this information.

### Connection to Research

**Important understanding**: When answering these questions, remember the research you already completed:
- Who's the audience? You covered that.
- Pain points? You covered that.
- Hopes and dreams? You covered that, giving you big promises.
- Future pacing dimensions? You explored this somewhat.

**Critical distinction**: You don't need to fill any of this out manually. Don't fill this document out from scratch unless you really want to. This is not a document you complete manually—it's generated by Claude.

### 6. Is there anything for the unique mechanism?
This is for the LLM to understand what mechanism should be teased early in the VSL lead.

**Examples**:
- "The 7-second bowel releasing ritual"
- "The 30-second breakfast hack"
- "Paper flipping" (to tease a real estate arbitrage method)

### 7. For supplements: What are the main ingredients in the formulation?
Include two to three studies showing efficacy for each main ingredient.

If you watched the bonus deep research supplement section, you understand this process.

### 8. Bold product claims
What's the huge promise or promises about the results they'll get from using the product or solution?

**Distinction**: This is different from question #3. These are specific, tangible promises and claims about how their life will change for the better once they buy the product.

### 9. What is the product?
Same as classic brief, but with more context for the LLM.

### 10. Background story / Journey
Slightly modified from classic brief with additional LLM context.

### 11. Who's the main speaker in the VSL?
Include a quick snapshot of who they are and their credibility.

**Examples**:
- The tired mom
- A doctor
- A customer of the brand who has had success

### 12. Is there a secondary speaker or expert who has a large role?
**Financial offer example**: Narrator/interviewer with expert being interviewed

**Medical VSL example**: Everyday person who finds a doctor, and the doctor has speaking lines throughout

### 13. Does the spokesperson partner with a brand or company once they've discovered the product?
Common VSL structure: Spokesperson or doctor finds a solution, then partners with the brand because the brand already had the solution in place with testimonials and social proof.

### 14. Testimonials or social proof (if available)
Include any available testimonials.

### 15. Credibility builders that can be used in the opening of the sales copy
**Examples**:
- References to studies about ingredients
- References to studies about the UMP (Unique Mechanism of Problem)
- "Scientists uncover the real cause of your problem"
- Tony Robbins endorsed the solution
- Program featured in Forbes or Good Morning America

**Copywriting examples**:
- "The 7-second bowel releasing ritual based on breakthrough research from Harvard"
- "A proven mental strength technique that transforms your mindset, so powerful even Tony Robbins shared it with his millions of followers"

**Important**: Hopefully these are true. If you have credibility builders, include them here.

### 16. What is the normal retail price for the product being sold?
Many VSLs and copy use: "The normal price is $200, but today only you can get it for $49."

### 17. What is the actual price?
The real price after discount (e.g., $49 in the example above).

### 18. If the VSL sells a product with multiple options, what are those options and pricing for each?
**Bundle example**:
- 1 bottle: $49 per bottle
- 3 bottles: $39 per bottle
- 6 bottles: $29 per bottle

**Package example**:
- Gold package: $97
- Platinum package (includes everything in gold plus additional items): $129

### 19. What is the guarantee?
**Example**: "If you're not happy within 180 days, simply message us and let us know, and we'll give you your money back, no questions asked."

### 20. Are there any bonuses? List them out.
Include all bonus offers that come with purchase.

### 21. Any other scarcity elements?
- Is there urgency?
- Limited time deal?
- Does the discount expire at midnight?
- Only for the first 100 people?
- Things of that nature

### 22. Please write specific future-paced results and benefits people could expect
Similar to question #4, but phrased differently.

**Note**: This appears twice in Brief 2.0. It may seem redundant, but it's already built into the Claude project, so it remains.

**Examples**:
- "You're going to be more confident"
- "You're going to feel energized"
- "Your clothes will fit better"
- "People will ask what you're doing differently"

### 23. What are common objections prospects might have while watching the VSL, and how can we answer them?
Covered in your research.

**Examples**:
- "I've tried supplements before and they haven't worked"
- "I've done coaching programs before and they were a waste of money"
- "I'm too busy for a workout program"

### 24. Are there any specific hooks or big ideas that you think should be tested in the lead of the VSL?
If you have ideas for hooks, record them here.

## How Brief 2.0 Actually Works

**You won't manually fill this out.**

Instead:
1. You'll create a Brief Generator in Claude
2. The generator will have this brief outline and specific instructions
3. You'll give it basic information (research document, mechanism, product details)
4. Claude will pump out the completed brief for you

## Next Steps

The next video will demonstrate creating the brief generator in Claude and show you how to generate comprehensive briefs from your research and mechanism work.

This Brief 2.0 becomes your master document for generating all copy types: VSLs, PDPs, advertorials, email sequences, and more.
